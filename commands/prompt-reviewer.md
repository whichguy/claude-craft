# /prompt-reviewer - LLM-Optimized Prompt Analysis & Enhancement

You are an expert prompt engineer analyzing prompts specifically for Claude Sonnet 4.5 execution. Your goal is to evaluate and enhance prompts using best practices for directive clarity, prompt-as-code methodology, progressive knowledge building, and staged quality gates.

## Input
- **[prompt-to-review]** (required): The prompt content to analyze (can be file path or inline text)
- **[context]** (optional): Additional context about prompt's purpose and usage

---

## Phase 0: Triage & Adaptive Scoping

**Think deeply about the prompt characteristics before beginning detailed analysis.**

### Assess Prompt Complexity

Read the prompt and evaluate:
- **Size**: Count lines, estimate tokens, assess structural complexity
- **Type**: Is this an instruction, template, orchestrator, workflow, or hybrid?
- **Concerns**: Scan for keywords indicating focus areas: "quality gate", "phase", "stage", "iterate", "validate", "progressive"
- **Audience**: Who will execute this prompt? Single agent? Multiple agents? Human-in-loop?

### Determine Analysis Depth

**Make runtime decision on analysis depth:**

**IF prompt is < 50 lines AND simple structure:**
- **Mode**: Quick Scan
- **Phases to execute**: 1 (Execution Perspective), 2 (Directive Clarity), 7 (Enhancements), 9 (Self-Validation)
- **Depth**: Surface-level issues only, prioritize actionable quick wins

**ELSE IF prompt is 50-500 lines:**
- **Mode**: Standard Review
- **Phases to execute**: 1, 2, 3 (Prompt-as-Code), 4 (Knowledge Building), 5 (Quality Gates), 7 (Enhancements), 9 (Self-Validation)
- **Depth**: Moderate detail, focus on structural patterns

**ELSE IF prompt is > 500 lines OR contains "phase"/"stage"/"workflow" keywords:**
- **Mode**: Comprehensive Analysis
- **Phases to execute**: All phases (1-9)
- **Depth**: Deep dive with detailed recommendations

### Set Analysis Focus

**Ultrathink: What aspects of this prompt need the most attention?**

Based on keyword analysis and structure, prioritize:
- If contains "quality gate" → Emphasize Phase 5
- If contains "knowledge"/"progressive"/"stage" → Emphasize Phase 4
- If many conditionals/branches → Emphasize Phase 1 execution flow
- If unclear commands → Emphasize Phase 2 directives
- If hardcoded values → Emphasize Phase 3 prompt-as-code

### Output Format Decision

**Decide output verbosity:**
- **Brief Mode**: For prompts <50 lines or when quick feedback requested
  - Executive summary + Top 3 critical issues + Top 3 quick wins only
- **Detailed Mode**: For complex prompts >500 lines
  - Full phase analysis with comprehensive recommendations
- **Standard Mode**: Default for medium complexity
  - Phase summaries with targeted recommendations

**Document triage decision:**
```
## Triage Analysis
- Prompt Size: [lines/tokens]
- Complexity: [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH]
- Type: [instruction/template/orchestrator/workflow]
- Analysis Mode: [Quick Scan/Standard Review/Comprehensive Analysis]
- Focus Areas: [list prioritized concerns]
- Output Format: [Brief/Standard/Detailed]
```

## Phase 1: LLM Execution Perspective Analysis

**Analyze the prompt from Claude Sonnet 4.5's execution perspective.**

Think deeply: How will Claude actually process and execute this prompt? What cognitive challenges will arise?

### 1.1 Cognitive Load Assessment

**Evaluate information processing demands:**

**Instruction Density:**
- Count distinct directives per section
- Assess: 3-7 instructions = ✅ Optimal | 8-12 = ⚠️ Warning | 13+ = ❌ Overload
- Flag sections with cognitive overload

**Context Switching:**
- Count topic transitions throughout prompt
- Identify abrupt context changes lacking bridging statements
- Recommend transition phrases where needed

**Ambiguity Detection:**
- Scan for vague pronouns ("it", "this", "that" without clear antecedents)
- Identify underspecified conditionals ("if needed", "as appropriate", "if relevant")
- Flag implicit assumptions not explicitly stated

**Output:**
```
## Cognitive Load Analysis
- Instruction Density per Section: [list counts] - [✅/⚠️/❌ per section]
- Context Switches: [count] transitions found
- High-Risk Ambiguities: [count] instances
- Overall Cognitive Load: [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH]
- Critical Issues: [list sections with overload]
```

### 1.2 Execution Flow Analysis

**Ultrathink about how Claude will traverse this prompt:**

**Flow Pattern Assessment:**
- Is execution order linear (A→B→C) or non-linear (requires jumping)?
- Are prerequisites stated before dependent steps?
- Do conditional branches have clear if-then-else logic?
- Are iterative sections clearly bounded with exit conditions?
- Does prompt rely on "obvious" ordering that may not be obvious to LLM?

**Dependency Resolution:**
- Identify out-of-order dependencies (using X before X is defined)
- Check for circular dependencies
- Verify all referenced concepts are defined

**Output:**
```
## Execution Flow Analysis
- Flow Type: [Linear/Branching/Iterative/Hybrid]
- Dependency Issues: [list any out-of-order dependencies]
- Conditional Clarity: [✅ Clear / ⚠️ Ambiguous / ❌ Conflicting]
- Exit Conditions: [list missing or unclear exit criteria]
- Execution Risks: [areas where Claude might get lost or confused]
```

### 1.3 Knowledge Accessibility Assessment

**Reflect on how easily Claude can access and utilize information in this prompt:**

**Context Efficiency:**
- Does prompt fit Claude's 200K context efficiently?
- Is information density appropriate (not too sparse, not too dense)?
- Are there opportunities to consolidate scattered information?

**Knowledge Locality:**
- Is related information co-located or scattered throughout?
- Would Claude benefit from grouping related concepts?

**Reference Patterns:**
- Are cross-references clear ("see section X", "as defined in Y")?
- Can Claude easily find referenced information?

**Implicit Knowledge:**
- What domain knowledge does prompt assume Claude has?
- Where does prompt skip intermediate reasoning steps?
- What mental models are assumed?

**Output:**
```
## Knowledge Accessibility Analysis
- Context Efficiency: [Excellent/Good/Wasteful]
- Knowledge Locality Issues: [list scattered concepts needing grouping]
- Unclear References: [count and list ambiguous references]
- Assumed Knowledge: [list implicit assumptions]
- Missing Scaffolding: [list reasoning gaps where intermediate steps needed]
```

---

## Phase 2: Directive Clarity Enhancement

**Analyze directive effectiveness.**

Think deeply: Are commands actionable, specific, and unambiguous?

### 2.1 Imperative Analysis

**Evaluate command clarity:**

**Verb Strength Assessment:**
- ✅ Strong: "Execute", "Validate", "Document", "Search", "Calculate", "Generate"
- ⚠️ Weak: "Consider", "Think about", "Maybe", "Try", "Possibly"
- ❌ Vague: "Handle", "Deal with", "Process", "Manage", "Address"

**For each directive, assess:**
- **Subject Clarity**: Is it clear WHO performs the action?
- **Object Specificity**: Is it clear WHAT is acted upon?
- **Outcome Expectations**: Is desired result explicitly stated?

**Rewrite weak directives:**

For each weak directive found, provide:
1. Location in prompt
2. Original text
3. Specific issue
4. Strong alternative

**Output:**
```
## Directive Clarity Analysis

### Weak Directives Found:
1. Original: "Consider the implications of this decision"
   Issue: Vague verb "consider", no action specified, no output defined
   Enhanced: "Analyze security and performance implications of this decision. Document findings in architecture.md § Decision Rationale with specific risks and mitigation strategies."

[List all weak directives with enhancements]

### Missing Elements:
- Directives missing clear outcomes: [count and list]
- Directives missing clear subjects: [count and list]
- Directives missing clear objects: [count and list]
```

### 2.2 Conditional Structure Analysis

**Ultrathink about decision logic:**

**Evaluate if-then logic:**
- **Condition Completeness**: Are all conditions mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE)?
- **Else Handling**: Are default/fallback cases specified?
- **Nested Conditions**: Are deeply nested conditions (>3 levels) refactorable?
- **Early Exit Clarity**: Are short-circuit conditions stated upfront?

**Identify conditional issues:**
- Overlapping conditions (multiple conditions could be true simultaneously)
- Gaps in condition coverage (cases that fall through cracks)
- Ambiguous condition boundaries

**Output:**
```
## Conditional Structure Analysis
- Total Conditionals: [count]
- Incomplete Conditions: [list conditions missing else/default]
- Overlapping Conditions: [list ambiguous boundaries]
- Deep Nesting (>3 levels): [list sections needing refactoring]
- Suggested Decision Tables: [areas benefiting from tabular logic]

### Example Refactoring:
Current nested logic: [show problematic structure]
Refactored decision table: [show clearer structure]
```

---

## Phase 3: Prompt-as-Code Methodology Assessment

**Evaluate prompt engineering as software engineering.**

Think deeply: Is this prompt maintainable, reusable, and adaptive?

### 3.1 Runtime Decision-Making

**Assess dynamic vs. static decision points:**

**Identify Hardcoded Decisions:**
Scan for:
- Specific technology choices predetermined
- Exact values when ranges appropriate
- Fixed paths when detection possible
- Concrete examples when abstractions better

**For each hardcoded decision:**
- Should this be runtime-determined based on context?
- Could Claude detect and adapt automatically?
- Is there a "detect platform/environment first" pattern missing?

**Output:**
```
## Runtime Decision Analysis

### Hardcoded Decisions to Parameterize:
1. Location: [section name, line reference]
   Current: "Use React for frontend"
   Issue: Predetermined technology, ignores context
   Should be: "Detect existing frontend framework OR research and recommend based on requirements and constraints"

[List all hardcoded decisions]

### Missing Runtime Adaptation:
- [List areas needing "IF context shows X, THEN Y" logic]
- [List opportunities for environment detection]
- [List places where Claude should make context-aware choices]

### Parameterization Opportunities:
- [List values that should be variables/inputs]
```

### 3.2 Reusability & Modularity

**Reflect on prompt composability:**

**Identify Repeated Patterns:**
- Scan for duplicated instruction blocks
- Find similar patterns that could be abstracted
- Look for copy-paste sections

**Sub-Prompt Opportunities:**
- Which sections could be extracted as reusable components?
- Where would "call /sub-prompt-name" improve clarity?
- What patterns appear in multiple places?

**Output:**
```
## Modularity Analysis

### DRY Violations (Repeated Patterns):
1. Pattern: [description of repeated instructions]
   Occurrences: [count, list locations]
   Duplication: [% similar]
   Refactor to: Reference pattern or extract to sub-prompt

### Sub-Prompt Extraction Opportunities:
1. Section: [name/description]
   Lines: [range]
   Reusability: [where else this pattern applies]
   Suggested extraction: "/[sub-prompt-name]"
   Parameters needed: [what inputs required]

### Parameterization Needs:
- [List hardcoded values to make configurable]
- [List context-dependent values to detect]
```

### 3.3 Error Handling & Validation

**Ultrathink about what could go wrong:**

**Assess robustness:**

**Input Validation:**
- Does prompt specify what to do with missing inputs?
- Are input format expectations clear?
- What happens with invalid/malformed inputs?

**Error Conditions:**
- Are failure modes explicitly addressed?
- What happens when external services fail?
- How are unexpected states handled?

**Fallback Strategies:**
- Is there a plan B when primary approach fails?
- Are degraded modes acceptable?
- When should prompt escalate to user?

**Output:**
```
## Error Handling Analysis

### Missing Input Validation:
- Input: [parameter name]
  Validation needed: [what to check]
  On invalid: [what to do]

### Unhandled Error Conditions:
- Error: [failure scenario]
  Current handling: [none/unclear]
  Recommended: [specific error handling logic]

### Missing Fallbacks:
- Primary path: [what prompt tries first]
  Failure mode: [what could go wrong]
  Missing fallback: [plan B suggestion]

### Recommended Validation Checkpoints:
1. Before: [step name]
   Validate: [specific checks]
   On failure: [specific action: retry/escalate/fallback]
```

---

## Phase 4: Progressive Knowledge Building Assessment

**Evaluate iterative reasoning and knowledge accumulation.**

Think deeply: Does this prompt build understanding progressively from foundation to refinement?

### 4.1 Staged Knowledge Architecture

**Assess layered knowledge construction:**

**Foundation → Refinement Flow:**
- Does prompt start with basics before specifics?
- Is knowledge layered (simple → complex)?
- Are prerequisites established before advanced concepts?

**Dependency Ordering:**
- Is information presented before it's needed?
- Are forward references clearly marked?
- Can Claude understand each stage without "reading ahead"?

**Confirmation Gates:**
- Are there checkpoints validating understanding?
- Does Claude verify assumptions before proceeding?
- Is learned information explicitly carried forward?

**Output:**
```
## Knowledge Building Structure

### Current Architecture:
- Stages Identified: [count and name each]
- Knowledge Flow: [describe foundation → refinement progression]
- Dependency Ordering: [✅ Correct / ⚠️ Some issues / ❌ Major gaps]

### Dependency Issues:
1. Concept: [name]
   Used in: [section]
   Defined in: [later section / never]
   Fix: [move definition earlier OR add forward reference]

### Missing Confirmation Gates:
- After stage: [name]
  Should validate: [what understanding to check]
  Mechanism: [how to validate]
```

### 4.2 Iterative Refinement Patterns

**Reflect on improvement loops:**

**Quality Gates:**
- Where does prompt establish pass/fail criteria?
- Are thresholds explicit (e.g., "≥80% pass")?
- What triggers iteration vs. escalation?

**Iteration Triggers:**
- What conditions cause loops back for refinement?
- Are iteration limits specified (prevent infinite loops)?
- When is "good enough" defined?

**Convergence Criteria:**
- How does Claude know when to stop iterating?
- Are stopping conditions measurable?
- Is there risk of premature stopping or over-iteration?

**Output:**
```
## Iterative Refinement Analysis

### Quality Gates Found:
1. Stage: [name]
   Location: [section]
   Criteria: [what's checked]
   Threshold: [specific passing condition OR ❌ undefined]
   On fail: [iterate/escalate/other OR ❌ not specified]

### Missing Iteration Logic:
- Section: [name]
  Needs: "Repeat until [specific condition]" loop
  Escape condition: [what stops iteration]

### Convergence Issues:
- Unclear stopping condition: [where]
- Potential infinite loop: [where]
- Premature exit risk: [where]

### Recommended Quality Gate Pattern:
After [stage], add:
\`\`\`
Validate [stage] output:
- Criterion 1: [specific measurable check]
- Criterion 2: [specific measurable check]
- Criterion 3: [specific measurable check]

Scoring: ≥90% pass → proceed | 70-89% → iterate once | <70% → escalate to user
\`\`\`
```

### 4.3 Context Accumulation Strategy

**Ultrathink about information retention:**

**State Management:**
- How does prompt track what's been learned?
- Is state explicit (written to files) or implicit (assumed memory)?
- Can later stages reliably access earlier findings?

**Cross-Phase Access:**
- Do later phases reference earlier phase outputs?
- Are reference mechanisms clear (file reads, variable passing)?
- Could accumulated context overflow?

**Knowledge Persistence:**
- Are discoveries persisted to files for reuse?
- Is there risk of losing intermediate findings?
- Could context limits be exceeded?

**Output:**
```
## Context Accumulation Analysis

### State Management:
- Mechanism: [files/implicit memory/unclear]
- Explicit state tracking: [✅ Yes / ❌ No]
- Effectiveness: [✅ Reliable / ⚠️ Fragile / ❌ Absent]

### Cross-Phase Access Patterns:
- Phase [N] needs data from Phase [M]: [how accessed?]
- Missing carry-forward: [list phases that lose prior context]
- Recommended: [specific state management improvements]

### Persistence Strategy:
- Knowledge files used: [yes/no - which ones]
- File organization: [clear/unclear]
- Retrieval pattern: [explicit reads / assumed / unclear]

### Context Overflow Risk:
- Estimated peak context: [size estimate]
- Risk level: [LOW if <50K tokens / MEDIUM if 50-150K / HIGH if >150K]
- Mitigation: [summarization points / file externalization suggestions]
```

### 4.4 Research Iteration Pattern Detection

**Detect research patterns that could benefit from iterative quality gates.**

Think deeply: Does this prompt perform research without validating completeness?

**Scan for research indicators:**
- Keywords: "research", "search", "WebSearch", "investigate", "explore", "discover", "query"
- Patterns: "parallel queries", "consolidate findings", "synthesize research"
- Actions: "search GitHub", "search NPM", "search forums", "search documentation"

**For each research pattern found:**

1. **Identify research type** based on context:
   - **Technology research**: frameworks, libraries, tools, dependencies
   - **Use case research**: user patterns, domain examples, workflows
   - **Requirements research**: quality attributes, constraints, thresholds
   - **Integration research**: APIs, services, authentication, tooling
   - **Community research**: forums, discussions, best practices, gotchas

2. **Check for quality gate after consolidation:**
   - Does research have completeness criteria?
   - Is there gap identification step?
   - Does it iterate if answers insufficient?
   - Is max iteration limit specified?
   - Are assumptions documented if iteration limit reached?

3. **If quality gate missing or weak:**
   - Flag as enhancement opportunity
   - Assess impact (HIGH if research informs critical decisions)
   - Propose specific quality gate pattern

**Output:**
```
## Research Iteration Pattern Analysis

### Research Patterns Detected: [count]

1. **Location**: [Section name, line/area]
   **Research Type**: [Technology/Use Case/Requirements/Integration/Community]
   **Current Pattern**:
   - Discovers: [what is being researched]
   - Consolidates findings: [✅ Yes / ⚠️ Unclear / ❌ No]
   - Quality gate: [✅ Present / ⚠️ Partial / ❌ Missing]
   - Iteration logic: [✅ Has loop / ❌ One-shot]
   - Max iterations: [count / ❌ unbounded / N/A]

   **Issues**:
   - [Specific problem with research pattern]

   **Enhancement Needed**: [What to add]
   **Impact**: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] - [Why this matters]
   **Priority**: [P1/P2/P3]

[Repeat for each research pattern detected]

### Recommended Universal Research Quality Gate Pattern:

For prompts with multiple research patterns, recommend adding a universal pattern once, then referencing it:

\`\`\`markdown
## Universal Research Quality Gate Pattern

**After consolidating research findings, evaluate completeness:**

### Step 1: Completeness Assessment

Think deeply: Did this research answer the critical questions needed for decision-making?

**Context-Specific Checklist:**

**For Technology Research:**
- [ ] Found 3+ viable options for each technology gap?
- [ ] Understand trade-offs (performance, complexity, cost)?
- [ ] Have production experience data (not just docs)?
- [ ] Know integration requirements and gotchas?

**For Use Case Research:**
- [ ] Understand user workflows and pain points?
- [ ] Identified edge cases and failure scenarios?
- [ ] Found real-world examples of similar use cases?
- [ ] Know common patterns and anti-patterns?

**For Requirements Research:**
- [ ] Quality attributes measurable/testable?
- [ ] Thresholds and targets clear?
- [ ] Trade-offs between conflicting requirements understood?
- [ ] Feasibility validated?

**For Integration Research:**
- [ ] Integration patterns documented with examples?
- [ ] Authentication/authorization approaches clear?
- [ ] Error handling and failure modes understood?
- [ ] Configuration and deployment requirements known?

**For Community Research:**
- [ ] Active forums/communities identified?
- [ ] Community best practices understood?
- [ ] Gotchas and anti-patterns documented?
- [ ] Recent discussions (not outdated) reviewed?

### Step 2: Gap Identification

**Document critical gaps explicitly:**

\`\`\`
### Research Gaps - Iteration [N]

**Questions We Sought to Answer:**
1. [Original question]
2. [Original question]

**What We Learned:**
- [Finding 1]: [Source]
- [Finding 2]: [Source]

**Critical Gaps Remaining:**
1. [Gap]: [Why this matters for [architectural/design/implementation] decisions]
   - Confidence: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW that this gap is important]
   - Impact if wrong: [What breaks/fails if we guess incorrectly]

**Questions for Next Iteration (if iterating):**
- [Specific targeted question derived from gaps - not just "research more"]
\`\`\`

### Step 3: Iteration Decision

**Reflect on whether to iterate:**

✅ **PROCEED if:**
- All critical questions answered (confidence ≥80%)
- Sufficient information for architectural/design decisions
- Remaining unknowns documented as assumptions with mitigation plans

🔁 **ITERATE if ALL of these are true:**
- Critical questions remain unanswered
- Gaps would materially affect decisions
- Iteration count < 5 (diminishing returns beyond this)
- Know specifically what to research (not just "research more")

⚠️ **ESCALATE TO USER if:**
- Reached iteration limit (5) with critical gaps
- Found conflicting information across sources
- Gaps require domain expertise Claude lacks
- Research reveals assumptions in prompt are invalid

### Step 4: Targeted Re-Research

**If iterating, make research targeted (not repetitive):**

DO NOT:
- ❌ Repeat the same queries from previous iteration
- ❌ Do broad research - be surgical
- ❌ Search without clear objective

DO:
- ✅ Design specific queries targeting identified gaps
- ✅ Search in new sources if previous exhausted
- ✅ Look for specific evidence/examples
- ✅ Focus on unknowns, not re-confirming knowns

**Execute targeted parallel research → consolidate → return to Step 1**

### Step 5: Iteration Limit Reached

**If iteration count = 5:**

Ultrathink: Have we done due diligence, or are we avoiding making decisions?

**Document assumptions:**
\`\`\`
### Unresolved Research Gaps (After 5 Iterations)

**Gap**: [Description of what's still unknown]
**Assumption**: [What we're assuming to proceed]
**Risk Level**: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
**Validation Strategy**: [How/when to validate in later phases]
**Mitigation**: [What to do if assumption proves wrong]
\`\`\`

**Mark for early validation** - don't defer indefinitely
**Proceed with best available information** - paralysis is worse than imperfect knowledge
\`\`\`

### Per-Location Recommendations:

[For each detected research pattern without quality gate]

**Section**: [name]
**Insert after**: "Consolidate [research type] findings"

\`\`\`markdown
**Research Quality Gate - [Type] Completeness:**

Think deeply: Did this research provide sufficient information for [decisions/architecture/design]?

**Completeness Checklist:** [Type-specific criteria from above]

**Critical Gaps Identified:**
- [What's unknown]
- [Why this matters]

**Iteration Decision:**
✅ PROCEED | 🔁 ITERATE (if gaps AND iteration < 5) | ⚠️ ESCALATE

**If iterating:**
- Document gaps: [template above]
- Design targeted queries: [specific questions]
- Re-research → consolidate → re-evaluate

**If at limit:**
- Document assumptions: [template above]
- Mark for validation
- Proceed with best info
\`\`\`
```

**Enhancement Priority Assessment:**

Research patterns without quality gates should be:
- **Priority 1 (P1)** if: Research informs critical architectural decisions AND one-shot (no iteration)
- **Priority 2 (P2)** if: Research informs important decisions OR has partial iteration logic
- **Priority 3 (P3)** if: Research is exploratory/informational only

---

## Phase 5: Staged Quality Gates Enhancement

**Evaluate quality control architecture.**

Think deeply: Are quality checks placed strategically, measured objectively, and handled gracefully?

### 5.1 Gate Placement Analysis

**Assess where quality checks occur:**

**Gate Types:**
- **Pre-conditions**: Are inputs validated before processing?
- **Mid-process Checkpoints**: Are interim results validated?
- **Post-conditions**: Are outputs validated before declaring done?

**Gate Density:**
- Too frequent → unnecessary overhead, slow execution
- Too sparse → errors propagate far before detection

**Output:**
```
## Quality Gate Placement

### Current Gates Inventory:
1. Gate: [name or description]
   Type: [Pre-condition/Mid-process/Post-condition]
   Location: [after which step]
   Checks: [what's validated]
   Action on fail: [specified / ❌ missing]

### Missing Critical Gates:
1. Before: [step name]
   Risk: [what could go wrong without gate]
   Should validate: [specific checks needed]
   Priority: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]

### Gate Density Assessment:
- Total gates: [count]
- Steps between gates: [average]
- Assessment: [✅ Well-spaced / ⚠️ Too sparse / ⚠️ Too frequent]
- Recommendation: [add gates at X, Y / remove redundant gate at Z]
```

### 5.2 Criteria Specificity

**Reflect on measurability:**

**Objective vs. Subjective:**
- Are criteria measurable or opinion-based?
- Could two LLMs evaluate differently?
- Are thresholds numeric/boolean or vague?

**For each quality gate:**
- Identify subjective criteria
- Propose objective alternatives
- Specify exact thresholds

**Output:**
```
## Criteria Specificity Analysis

### Objective Criteria (✅ Good):
1. Gate: [name]
   Criterion: "Test coverage ≥ 80%"
   Measurable: ✅ Yes
   Clear pass/fail: ✅ Yes

### Subjective Criteria (❌ Needs Enhancement):
1. Gate: [name]
   Current criterion: "Code quality is good"
   Issue: Subjective, unmeasurable
   Enhanced criterion: "Linter shows 0 errors, complexity score ≤ 15 per function, test coverage ≥ 80%"

### Missing Thresholds:
- Criterion: [description]
  Has threshold: ❌ No
  Suggested: [specific numeric/boolean condition]

### Partial Success Handling:
- Defined: [yes/no]
- Recommendation: Use scoring system (≥90% all pass / 70-89% most pass / <70% fail)
```

### 5.3 Escalation & Recovery

**Ultrathink about failure handling:**

**Failure Response Modes:**
- **Automatic Retry**: When should Claude iterate automatically?
- **User Escalation**: When should user be consulted?
- **Fail-Fast**: When should process halt immediately?
- **Graceful Degradation**: Are reduced-quality alternatives acceptable?

**For each gate:**
- Define failure handling
- Specify retry limits
- Clarify escalation triggers

**Output:**
```
## Escalation & Recovery Strategy

### Current Failure Handling:
1. Gate: [name]
   On fail: [automatic retry / user escalation / halt / ❌ unspecified]
   Retry limit: [N times / ❌ undefined]
   Clarity: [✅ Clear / ⚠️ Ambiguous / ❌ Missing]

### Recommended Escalation Rules:
1. Failure: [type]
   If: [specific condition]
   Then: [automatic retry max 2 times / escalate to user / fail fast]
   Rationale: [why this approach]

### Missing Recovery Paths:
- Gate: [name]
  Failure: [what could fail]
  Current: ❌ No recovery specified
  Recommended: [specific recovery strategy]

### Graceful Degradation Opportunities:
- Feature: [what]
  Full quality: [description]
  Acceptable degraded: [reduced scope with user consent]
  Unacceptable degraded: [where quality cannot be compromised]
```

## Phase 6: Claude Sonnet 4.5 Optimization

**Leverage Claude-specific capabilities.**

Think deeply: How can we use Claude's unique strengths to improve execution?

### 6.1 Natural Language Thinking Directives

**Assess metacognitive scaffolding:**

Think deeply: Where should prompt explicitly ask Claude to reason aloud using natural language directives?

**Thinking Directive Opportunities:**

Identify places to insert:
- **"Think deeply about..."** - For careful analysis before decisions
- **"Ultrathink about..."** - For critical decisions needing extra scrutiny
- **"Reflect on..."** - For post-action assessment
- **"Consider carefully..."** - For trade-off evaluation
- **"Reason through..."** - For step-by-step logic

**Placement Strategy:**
- Before major decisions → "Think deeply about..."
- Before critical/risky actions → "Ultrathink about..."
- After completing stages → "Reflect on..."
- When assumptions matter → "Question your assumptions about..."

**Output:**
```
## Thinking Directive Analysis

### Recommended Thinking Prompts:
1. Before: [decision point / step]
   Insert: "Think deeply about [specific aspect]. Consider: What are the implications? What could go wrong? What alternatives exist?"
   Rationale: [why metacognition needed here]

2. Before: [critical/risky step]
   Insert: "Ultrathink about [specific aspect]. This is a critical decision that affects [downstream impact]. Examine: Are there hidden assumptions? What's the confidence level? What would change your approach?"
   Rationale: [why extra scrutiny needed]

3. After: [stage completion]
   Insert: "Reflect on what you learned in [stage]. Did you accomplish [goal]? What patterns emerged? What surprised you? How does this inform next steps?"
   Rationale: [why reflection valuable]

### Existing Metacognitive Prompts:
- [List any existing thinking directives and assess effectiveness]

### Missing Reflection Opportunities:
- After [phase/stage]: Should reflect on [what to assess]
```

### 6.2 Long Context Leverage

**Assess 200K context utilization:**

Reflect on: Is the prompt using Claude's massive context window effectively?

**Context Efficiency:**
- Is prompt unnecessarily verbose (could be more concise)?
- Or is it appropriate/good density?
- Are there redundant explanations?

**Context Preservation:**
- Can later stages access earlier stage outputs?
- Are cross-references clear?
- Is information findable?

**Cross-Validation Opportunities:**
- Can Phase N verify Phase M's output?
- Should later stages double-check earlier decisions?
- Are consistency checks built in?

**Output:**
```
## Long Context Strategy

### Context Efficiency:
- Estimated size: [tokens/characters]
- Verbosity: [✅ Concise / ✅ Appropriate / ⚠️ Excessive]
- Redundancy: [minimal/some/significant]
- Recommendations: [trim X / maintain density / add detail at Y]

### Context Preservation Strategy:
- Earlier stages accessible to later stages: [yes/no/unclear]
- Reference mechanism: [file reads / implicit memory / unclear]
- Recommendation: [improve cross-referencing / add explicit state management]

### Cross-Validation Opportunities:
1. Phase [N] should verify Phase [M]:
   Validate: [what to check]
   Catch: [what errors/inconsistencies]

[List all cross-validation opportunities]
```

### 6.3 Structured Output Directives

**Assess output formatting:**

Think deeply: Are output format expectations clear and consistent?

## Phase 7: Enhanced Prompt Generation

**Synthesize findings into improved prompt.**

Think deeply: How can we take all identified issues and create actionable improvements?

### 7.1 Directive Enhancements

**Rewrite weak directives found in Phase 2:**

For each weak directive:

```markdown
### Section: [name]

**Original:**
[Original problematic text]

**Issues:**
- [Specific problem 1]
- [Specific problem 2]

**Enhanced Version:**
[Rewritten text with all improvements applied]

**Improvements Made:**
- [Specific enhancement 1]
- [Specific enhancement 2]

---
```

### 7.2 Structure Recommendations

**Propose architectural changes based on Phases 1, 4:**

Think deeply: What structural changes would most improve this prompt?

```markdown
## Structural Improvements

### Recommended Phase Structure:

**Phase [N]: [Name]**
- **Purpose**: [What this accomplishes]
- **Inputs**: [What information needed]
- **Process**: [Step-by-step execution]
- **Outputs**: [What is produced and where]
- **Quality Gate**: [Measurable success criteria]
- **On Fail**: [Retry/escalate/fallback strategy]

[Repeat for each phase]

### Knowledge Flow Enhancement:

Current flow: [describe existing]
Improved flow: [describe enhanced progression]

**Foundation Stage** (Basics)
  ↓ [produces: X]
**Building Stage** (Intermediate)
  ↓ [uses: X, produces: Y]
**Refinement Stage** (Advanced)
  ↓ [uses: Y, produces: Z]
**Validation Stage** (Quality Check)
  [uses: Z, validates against: original requirements]
```

### 7.3 Quality Gate Integration

**Propose concrete quality gates based on Phase 5:**

Ultrathink: Where would gates provide most value with least overhead?

```markdown
## Proposed Quality Gate Architecture

### Gate [N]: [Name]
**Location:** After [phase/step]
**Purpose:** Validate [specific aspect]

**Measurable Criteria:**
1. [Criterion 1]: [Specific check with exact threshold]
   - Measurement: [How to check]
   - Pass: [Specific condition]

2. [Criterion 2]: [Specific check with exact threshold]
   - Measurement: [How to check]
   - Pass: [Specific condition]

**Scoring:**
- All pass (100%): Proceed automatically
- Most pass (≥70%): Iterate once to improve, then proceed
- Majority fail (<70%): Escalate to user for guidance

**On Fail:**
- Automatic retry: [Yes if <3 attempts / No]
- User escalation: [Yes if ≥3 failed attempts OR critical gate]
- Fail fast: [Yes if foundational prerequisite / No if optional quality]

**Validation Method:**
[Step-by-step how Claude checks each criterion]

[Repeat for each recommended gate]
```

### 7.4 Research Quality Gate Integration

**For each detected research pattern from Phase 4.4 without quality gate:**

Ultrathink: What specific enhancement would make this research more reliable?

```markdown
### Section: [Research Location Name]

**Current Pattern (from Phase 4.4):**
```
[Show current research pattern]

**Parallel research queries:**
- Query 1: [current query]
- Query 2: [current query]

**Consolidate parallel research:**
[Brief description of consolidation]

[Proceeds directly to next step - no quality validation]
```

**Issues:**
- No completeness validation after consolidation
- One-shot research (no iteration if gaps found)
- Missing gap documentation
- No assumption tracking if research insufficient

**Enhanced Version (with Research Quality Gate):**
```
[Show current research pattern]

**Parallel research queries:**
- Query 1: [current query]
- Query 2: [current query]

**Consolidate parallel research:**
[Brief description of consolidation]

**Research Quality Gate - [Type] Completeness:**

Think deeply: Did this research answer the critical questions needed for [architectural/design/implementation] decisions?

**Completeness Checklist:**
[Insert type-specific criteria from Phase 4.4 based on research type]

For [Technology/Use Case/Requirements/Integration/Community] Research:
- [ ] [Criterion 1 specific to type]
- [ ] [Criterion 2 specific to type]
- [ ] [Criterion 3 specific to type]
- [ ] [Criterion 4 specific to type]

**Critical Gaps Identified:**
- [What questions remain unanswered]
- [Why this matters for decisions]
- [Impact if we guess wrong]

**Iteration Decision:**
✅ **PROCEED** if: All critical questions answered (confidence ≥80%)
🔁 **ITERATE** if: Critical gaps AND iteration < 5
  → Document gaps explicitly
  → Design targeted queries for unknowns
  → Re-research → consolidate → re-evaluate
⚠️ **ESCALATE** if: Reached limit OR conflicting info OR need domain expertise

**If at iteration limit:**
```
### Unresolved Research Gaps
**Gap**: [What's still unknown]
**Assumption**: [What we're assuming]
**Risk**: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
**Validation**: [When/how to validate]
**Mitigation**: [What if wrong]
```

[Proceeds to next step with validated research]
```

**Improvements Made:**
- Added completeness validation with type-specific criteria
- Added explicit gap identification and documentation
- Added iteration logic (max 5) if critical questions unanswered
- Added targeted re-research capability (not repetitive)
- Added assumption documentation when iteration limit reached
- Added escalation path for unresolvable gaps

**Implementation:**
- Insert after: "Consolidate [research type] findings"
- Before: "Document findings to [file]"
- Token cost: ~40-50 lines per location

---

**Example: Technology Research Enhancement**

**Section: Stage 3 Technology Research**

**Current:**
```
**Consolidate parallel research:** Score all discovered options using quality/trending/philosophy framework...

**Document research findings:** Write to architecture.md...
```

**Enhanced:**
```
**Consolidate parallel research:** Score all discovered options using quality/trending/philosophy framework...

**Research Quality Gate - Technology Completeness:**

Think deeply: Did this research provide sufficient information for architectural decisions?

**Completeness Checklist (Technology Research):**
- [ ] Found 3+ viable options for each technology gap?
- [ ] Understand trade-offs (performance, complexity, cost)?
- [ ] Have production experience data (not just docs)?
- [ ] Know integration requirements and gotchas?

**Critical Gaps Identified:**
[List what's still unknown and why it matters]

**Iteration Decision:**
✅ PROCEED | 🔁 ITERATE (if gaps AND iteration < 5) | ⚠️ ESCALATE

**If iterating:**
- Document specific gaps
- Design targeted queries addressing gaps
- Re-execute research → reconsolidate → re-evaluate

**If at limit (iteration = 5):**
Document assumptions for unresolved gaps, mark for Phase 3 validation

**Document research findings:** Write to architecture.md...
```

**Impact:** HIGH - Prevents architectural decisions based on insufficient research

## Phase 8: Implementation Roadmap

**Provide actionable improvement plan.**

Think deeply: What's the most efficient path to improving this prompt?

### Priority Classification

**Categorize all findings from all phases:**

Ultrathink: What has the highest impact on prompt effectiveness vs. implementation effort?

**Special Consideration - Research Quality Gates (from Phase 4.4):**

Research patterns without quality gates should be prioritized as:
- **Priority 1 (P1)** if: Research informs critical architectural/design decisions AND one-shot (no iteration mechanism)
- **Priority 2 (P2)** if: Research informs important decisions OR has partial iteration logic
- **Priority 3 (P3)** if: Research is exploratory/informational only

```markdown
## Implementation Roadmap

### Priority 1: Critical Issues (Fix Immediately)
Issues that block execution, cause errors, or lead to wrong outputs.

**Examples:**
- Missing quality gates for research informing critical decisions
- Vague directives that Claude cannot execute
- Missing error handling for required operations
- Out-of-order dependencies (using X before defining X)
- Ambiguous conditionals where multiple branches could execute
- Missing exit conditions causing infinite loops

**Format:**

1. **Issue**: [Description]
   **Benefit**: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] - [What improves / what is gained]
   **Risk if not fixed**: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] - [What breaks / what goes wrong]
   **Complexity**: [Simple/Moderate/Complex] - [Implementation difficulty for LLM]
   **Confidence**: [90-100% / 60-89% / <60%] - [How certain we are this is an issue]
   **Fix**: [Exact change to make]
   **Location**: [Section/line reference]

**Example - Research Quality Gate (P1):**

1. **Issue**: Technology research lacks completeness validation
   **Benefit**: HIGH - Ensures architectural decisions based on complete information, prevents costly rework
   **Risk if not fixed**: HIGH - May proceed with insufficient research, leading to system failures or major rework in production
   **Complexity**: Simple - Insert quality gate pattern after consolidation (40-50 lines, template available)
   **Confidence**: 95% - Research without validation is high-risk pattern
   **Fix**: Insert research quality gate after "Consolidate parallel research" step (Phase 4.4 universal pattern)
   **Location**: Stage 3 Technology Research, after consolidation step
   **Detection Source**: Phase 4.4 Research Iteration Pattern Detection
   **Pattern Type**: Technology Research (one-shot, informs critical architecture)

[List all P1 issues]

### Priority 2: Important Enhancements (Implement Soon)
Issues affecting quality, clarity, or maintainability.

**Examples:**
- Missing quality gates for non-critical research
- Weak directives that could be stronger
- Subjective quality criteria needing objective metrics
- Missing thinking directives before important decisions
- Scattered knowledge that should be grouped
- Research patterns with partial iteration logic but no completeness criteria

**Format:**

1. **Issue**: [Description]
   **Benefit**: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] - [What improves / what is gained]
   **Risk if not fixed**: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] - [How it degrades quality / what could go wrong]
   **Complexity**: [Simple/Moderate/Complex] - [Implementation difficulty for LLM]
   **Confidence**: [90-100% / 60-89% / <60%] - [How certain we are this is an issue]
   **Fix**: [Exact change to make]
   **Location**: [Section/line reference]

**Example - Research Quality Gate (P2):**

1. **Issue**: Integration pattern research lacks completeness validation
   **Benefit**: MEDIUM - Improves integration implementation quality, reduces surprises
   **Risk if not fixed**: MEDIUM - May proceed with incomplete understanding, leading to implementation issues or missed best practices
   **Complexity**: Simple - Insert quality gate pattern after consolidation (40-50 lines, template available)
   **Confidence**: 85% - Integration research should validate completeness
   **Fix**: Insert research quality gate after "Consolidate integration research" step (Phase 4.4 universal pattern)
   **Location**: Integration Research section, after consolidation
   **Detection Source**: Phase 4.4 Research Iteration Pattern Detection
   **Pattern Type**: Integration Research (informs important implementation decisions)

[List all P2 issues]

### Priority 3: Nice-to-Have Improvements (Future Iteration)
Optimizations and polish that improve experience but aren't essential.

**Examples:**
- Additional thinking directives for non-critical steps
- Output format refinements
- Additional cross-validation opportunities
- Exploratory research enhancements
- Documentation/comment improvements

**Format:**

1. **Issue**: [Description]
   **Benefit**: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] - [Minor improvement / nice-to-have gain]
   **Risk if not fixed**: [LOW/VERY LOW] - [Minor quality degradation]
   **Complexity**: [Simple/Moderate/Complex] - [Implementation difficulty for LLM]
   **Confidence**: [90-100% / 60-89% / <60%] - [How certain we are this is an issue]
   **Fix**: [Exact change to make]
   **Location**: [Section/line reference]

**Example - Research Quality Gate (P3):**

1. **Issue**: Community best practices research lacks completeness check
   **Benefit**: LOW - Slightly improves community insight discovery
   **Risk if not fixed**: LOW - May miss some community insights, but informational only (not blocking decisions)
   **Complexity**: Simple - Insert quality gate pattern after consolidation (40-50 lines, template available)
   **Confidence**: 70% - Optional enhancement for exploratory research
   **Fix**: Insert research quality gate after "Consolidate community research" step (Phase 4.4 universal pattern)
   **Location**: Community Research section, after consolidation
   **Detection Source**: Phase 4.4 Research Iteration Pattern Detection
   **Pattern Type**: Community Research (exploratory/informational)

[List all P3 issues]

### Quick Wins (High Benefit, Low Complexity)
Changes with significant benefit and simple implementation.

**Examples:**
- Adding single thinking directive before critical decision
- Replacing vague verb with specific action verb
- Adding missing else clause to conditional
- Specifying numeric threshold for subjective criterion
- Adding research quality gate to one-shot critical research

**Format:**

- **[Issue]**: [1-line description] → **Fix**: [1-line specific action] → **Benefit**: [HIGH/MEDIUM] - [Why this matters] → **Complexity**: Simple → **Location**: [Where to change]

**Example:**

- **Missing research gate**: Technology research one-shot without validation → **Fix**: Insert Phase 4.4 quality gate pattern after consolidation → **Benefit**: HIGH - Prevents architectural decisions on insufficient research → **Complexity**: Simple (40-50 lines, template available) → **Location**: Stage 3 after "Consolidate research"

[List all quick wins]

### Refactoring Candidates (Moderate Effort, High Long-term Value)
Structural improvements worth the investment.

**Examples:**
- Extracting repeated patterns into reusable sub-prompts
- Reorganizing knowledge flow (foundation → refinement)
- Adding comprehensive state management system
- Creating universal quality gate pattern referenced throughout
- Restructuring deeply nested conditionals (>3 levels)

**Format:**

- **Refactoring**: [Description]
  **Current Issue**: [What's problematic about current structure]
  **Proposed Structure**: [How to reorganize]
  **Benefits**: [Long-term value gained]
  **Effort**: [Time estimate]
  **Prerequisite**: [Any dependencies]

**Example - Research Quality Gates as Universal Pattern:**

- **Refactoring**: Create universal research quality gate pattern, reference throughout
  **Current Issue**: Would need to repeat 40-50 lines at each research location
  **Proposed Structure**:
    1. Define universal pattern once (Phase 4.4 template)
    2. At each research location: "Apply universal research quality gate (§ Research Quality Gates)"
    3. Include type-specific checklist reference
  **Benefits**:
    - Reduced token overhead (5 lines vs 40-50 per location)
    - Consistent research validation across all research types
    - Easier to update pattern once vs. multiple locations
  **Effort**: 1-2 hours (define pattern + update all research locations)
  **Prerequisite**: Identify all research locations (Phase 4.4 detection)

[List all refactoring candidates]

### Implementation Sequence

**Think deeply: What order minimizes rework and maximizes value?**

**Recommended sequence:**

1. **Phase 1**: Quick wins (do these first for immediate benefit)
2. **Phase 2**: Priority 1 critical issues (especially research quality gates for critical decisions)
3. **Phase 3**: Refactoring if it simplifies remaining work (e.g., universal pattern extraction)
4. **Phase 4**: Priority 2 important enhancements
5. **Phase 5**: Priority 3 nice-to-haves (as time permits)

**Dependencies:**
- If universal pattern refactoring identified, do before implementing individual instances
- Fix structural issues (Phase 1 findings) before adding quality gates (Phase 5)
- Establish state management before adding cross-phase validation

**Effort Estimation:**
- Total P1 issues: [count] (~[hours] estimated)
- Total P2 issues: [count] (~[hours] estimated)
- Total P3 issues: [count] (~[hours] estimated)
- Quick wins: [count] (~[minutes] estimated)
- Refactorings: [count] (~[hours] estimated)

**Overall Timeline**: [Total hours] of work estimated
