### Phase Purpose & Dependencies

**PHASE_PURPOSE**: Implement a single task completely according to specifications and architecture

**DEPENDENCIES**:
- Task file: `<prompt-arguments>` with acceptance criteria
- Architecture decisions: `<worktree>/planning/architecture.md`
- Existing codebase: Local or remote systems
- Test infrastructure: As defined in architecture

**DELIVERABLES**:
- Fully implemented feature with all acceptance criteria met
- Complete test coverage following architecture patterns
- Task moved from pending/ to completed/
- Discovery report of adjacent tasks and issues

---

## Phase Activities

### 1. Rehydration & Intelligence Loading

Load accumulated wisdom and context:

**DETERMINE EXECUTION CONTEXT**:
From architecture.md, identify target platform:
- **Local Development**: Traditional src/, test/ structure
- **Google Apps Script**: Remote project accessed via gas_* MCP commands
- **Salesforce**: Remote org accessed via sf_* or sfdx commands
- **AWS/Azure/GCP**: Cloud services via CLI/SDK
- **Other PaaS/IaaS**: Platform-specific access methods

**LOAD TASK SPECIFICATIONS**:
Read task file from `<prompt-arguments>`:
- Task ID and name
- Epic and story mappings
- Acceptance criteria (ALL must be implemented)
- Dependencies on other tasks
- Testing requirements
- Priority and effort estimates

**LOAD ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS**:
Read `<worktree>/planning/architecture.md` to extract:
- **Platform**: Local, GoogleAppsScript, Salesforce, AWS, etc.
- **Testing Framework**: (e.g., "Mocha+Chai", "Jest", "Pytest", "Apex")
- **Test Commands**: Exact commands to run tests
- **Test Location**: Local directory or remote location
- **Programming Language**: Language and version
- **Code Patterns**: Architectural patterns to follow
- **Dependencies**: Approved libraries and versions
- **File Structure**: Standard organization (no features/ subdirectory)

**EXPLORE EXISTING CODE**:

FOR LOCAL SYSTEMS:
```
Examine <worktree>/src/ for patterns
Review <worktree>/test/ for test examples
```

FOR GOOGLE APPS SCRIPT:
```
gas_ls <project-id> to list files
gas_cat <project-id> <file> to read code
gas_grep <project-id> "pattern" to search
```

FOR SALESFORCE:
```
sf project retrieve --metadata ApexClass
sf apex list --type class
```

**DISCOVER TEST PATTERNS**:
Review existing tests in architecture-specified location:
- Test structure and organization
- Assertion patterns
- Test data patterns
- Coverage expectations

Document rehydration results for reference during implementation.

### 2. Input Extraction & Validation

Extract what this task needs:

**FROM TASK FILE**:
- List of ALL acceptance criteria (mandatory)
- Testing requirements (unit, integration, e2e)
- Dependencies on other completed tasks
- Performance requirements if specified
- Security requirements if specified

**FROM ARCHITECTURE**:
- Platform and access methods
- Specific test framework and syntax
- Exact test commands to use
- Required dependencies and versions
- Mandated code patterns
- File organization rules

**VALIDATION CHECKS**:
- Verify all required dependencies are available
- Check that dependent tasks are completed
- Ensure architecture document has all needed information
- Confirm test framework is installed/accessible

**MISSING INPUTS**: Document any gaps and how to proceed

### 3. Criteria Definition (Runtime Intelligence)

Define success criteria based on task and architecture:

**SUCCESS_CRITERIA**: What constitutes completion
- ALL acceptance criteria from task implemented
- All tests passing with architecture test command
- Code follows architecture patterns exactly
- Code review approved with no critical issues
- Test coverage meets architecture requirements
- No regression in existing tests
- Documentation updated as needed

**ANTI_CRITERIA**: What must be avoided
- Deviating from architecture decisions
- Using unapproved dependencies
- Breaking existing functionality
- Incomplete implementation of any criterion
- Tests that don't follow framework patterns
- Code that doesn't match style guide

**DEPENDENCY_CRITERIA**: External requirements
- Architecture-specified libraries available
- Test framework properly configured
- Required services/APIs accessible
- Database/storage as per architecture
- Remote system access if applicable

### 4. Research & Discovery

Investigate codebase guided by architecture:

**EXPLORE CODE STRUCTURE**:

FOR LOCAL:
```
src/             # Standard source directory
test/            # Test directory
lib/             # Libraries if needed
```

FOR REMOTE SYSTEMS:
```
# Google Apps Script
gas_ls to understand structure
gas_grep to find patterns

# Salesforce
Query metadata structure
Review existing Apex patterns

# Cloud platforms
Check deployed functions
Review infrastructure as code
```

**RESEARCH PATTERNS**:
Following architecture specifications:
- Authentication patterns if needed
- Data validation approaches
- API integration methods
- State management patterns
- Error handling conventions

**TEST DISCOVERY**:
In architecture-specified test location:
- Similar test suites for reference
- Test utilities and helpers
- Mock/stub patterns
- Test data factories

**DOCUMENT FINDINGS**: Note all reusable elements and patterns

**DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:

Based on visualizations and architecture:

**PHASE 1: TEST CREATION** (Tests First)
```yaml
Step 1.1: Create test file
  Local: test/feature.test.js
  Remote GAS: gas_write test-framework/FeatureTest.gs
  Remote SF: Deploy FeatureTest.cls

Step 1.2: Code review tests
  Command: ask subagent code-reviewer [test-file]

Step 1.3: Run tests (expect failure)
  Local: [architecture test command]
  Remote GAS: gas_run "TestRunner.run('FeatureTest')"
  Remote SF: sf apex test run --test-name FeatureTest
```

**PHASE 2: INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION**
```yaml
Step 2.1: Create implementation file
  Local: src/feature.js
  Remote GAS: gas_write Feature.gs
  Remote SF: Deploy Feature.cls

Step 2.2-2.N: Implement test cases incrementally
  For each test:
    - Write minimal code
    - Review code
    - Run specific test
    - Fix if needed
```

**PHASE 3: INTEGRATION**
```yaml
Step 3.1: Modify integration points
  Local: Update exports/imports
  Remote: Update module connections

Step 3.2: Run integration tests
  Verify feature works with system
```

**PHASE 4: FINALIZATION**
```yaml
Step 4.1: Enhance test coverage
Step 4.2: Documentation
Step 4.3: Cleanup deprecated code
```

### 6. Review & Validation

Before executing, validate the plan:

**ARCHITECTURE ALIGNMENT**:
- Plan uses only architecture-approved technologies
- File locations match architecture structure
- Test approach follows architecture patterns
- Dependencies are all pre-approved

**COMPLETENESS CHECK**:
- Every acceptance criterion has test coverage
- All required integrations identified
- No missing implementation steps
- Documentation needs identified

**FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT**:
- Can be implemented with available dependencies
- No blockers from uncompleted tasks
- Reasonable within effort estimate

IF plan incomplete or misaligned:
  Return to Planning (activity 5) with issues identified
OTHERWISE:
  Proceed to execution

### 7. Execution

Implement the plan with test-driven development:

**STEP 1 - Write ALL Tests First**:

FOR LOCAL SYSTEMS:
```javascript
// Create: test/feature.test.js
describe('Feature Name', () => {
  it('should meet acceptance criterion 1', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

FOR GOOGLE APPS SCRIPT:
```javascript
// Create remote test
gas_write <project-id> test-framework/FeatureTest.gs `
function testFeatureCriterion1() {
  const result = Feature.someFunction();
  if (result !== expected) throw new Error('Test failed');
  return 'PASS';
}

function runAllTests() {
  return TestRunner.run([
    testFeatureCriterion1
  ]);
}
`
```

FOR SALESFORCE:
```apex
// Deploy test class
@isTest
public class FeatureTest {
    @isTest
    static void testFeatureCriterion1() {
        // Test implementation
        System.assertEquals(expected, actual);
    }
}
```

**STEP 2 - Code Review Tests**:
```
# For local files:
ask subagent code-reviewer test/feature.test.js

# For remote content:
ask subagent code-reviewer "Review test code: [content]"
```

**STEP 3 - Run Tests (Expect Failure)**:
Execute architecture-specified test command:
```
Local: [architecture.test_command_single]
GAS: gas_run <id> "require('test-framework/FeatureTest').runAllTests()"
SF: sf apex test run --test-name FeatureTest
```

**STEP 4 - Implement Feature Incrementally**:
FOR each test or test group:
  1. Write minimum code to pass the test
  2. Code review the implementation:
     ```
     ask subagent code-reviewer <file-or-content>
     ```
  3. Fix review issues
  4. Run test to verify it passes
  5. Refactor if needed (maintain passing tests)
  6. Continue to next test

**STEP 5 - Integration Implementation**:
- Connect feature to existing system
- Update any affected modules
- Code review integration points

**STEP 6 - Revisit and Enhance Tests**:
Based on implementation learnings:
- Add edge cases discovered during coding
- Add regression tests for bugs found
- Enhance assertions with actual behavior
- Add performance tests if needed
- Code review enhanced tests

**STEP 7 - Documentation**:
- Add code comments for complex logic
- Update API documentation if applicable
- Update user documentation if needed
- Code review documentation

### 8. Quality Iteration Loop

Iterate until quality standards met:

FOR iteration FROM 1 TO 10:

  **STEP 1 - Comprehensive Code Review**:
  Review all changed files together:
  ```
  ask subagent code-reviewer [all-files]
  ```

  **STEP 2 - Run Complete Test Suite**:
  Execute architecture test command for feature:
  ```
  Local: [architecture.test_command_feature]
  GAS: gas_run "TestRunner.runSuite('Feature')"
  SF: sf apex test run --suite-name FeatureSuite
  ```

  **STEP 3 - Check Acceptance Criteria**:
  Verify EACH criterion from task file:
  - [ ] Criterion 1 implemented and tested
  - [ ] Criterion 2 implemented and tested
  - [ ] All criteria checked

  **STEP 4 - Validate Architecture Compliance**:
  - Code follows specified patterns
  - Uses only approved dependencies
  - Matches file organization rules
  - Test structure follows framework conventions

  **STEP 5 - Calculate Quality Score**:
  - Code review approved: 30%
  - All tests passing: 30%
  - All acceptance criteria met: 25%
  - Architecture compliance: 15%

  IF quality score >= 90% THEN:
    Break from loop (proceed to Activity 9)

  OTHERWISE:
    **KEY LEARNING**: Document iteration discoveries
    Fix identified issues
    Continue iteration

### 9. Documentation & Knowledge Capture
