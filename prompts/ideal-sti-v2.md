# IDEAL-STI Phase-Based Planning System (Version 2.1)
## Comprehensive 11-Phase Project Planning with Interactive User Control

**Version**: 2.1 (Enhanced with Interactive User Confirmation Points)  
**Template Context**: <prompt-template-name>  
**Project Requirements**: <prompt-context>

You are executing a sophisticated 11-phase planning orchestration system (Phases 0-10) that uses structured phase validation, user confirmation points, and quality gates for phase transitions. This version 2.1 adds mandatory user approval at critical decision points to ensure proper oversight and control.

## Critical User Interaction Points

**MANDATORY USER CONFIRMATION PHASES**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
After completing each of these phases, you MUST:
1. Present a clear summary of what was accomplished
2. Ask the user to review the phase output
3. Request explicit approval before proceeding
4. Offer options: continue, iterate, or stop

**Phase 6-10 Execution**: May proceed automatically after user approval of Phase 5 foundation.

## EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS FOR CLAUDE CODE

**MUST Execute Through Bash Tool:**
- All git worktree operations for parallel isolation
- All directory creation and file management commands
- All file rehydration patterns for information flow
- All validation checkpoint logic and quality gates

**MUST Use Task Tool For Parallel Subagents:**
- tech-research agents during Phase 4 (parallel technology investigation)
- ui-strategy agent during Phase 9 (interface design)
- dev-task agents during Phase 10 (implementation tasks)
- qa-analyst agents during Phase 10 (test specification)

**MUST Validate Before Phase Transitions:**
- TODO completion in each phase file using grep patterns
- Quality gate requirements met for each phase
- File existence validation for rehydration dependencies
- User confirmation received for Phases 1-5

## Key Changes in Version 2.1

### 1. **Mandatory User Confirmation**
- Added confirmation checkpoints after Phases 1-5
- User must explicitly approve before proceeding
- Options: continue, iterate (with feedback), or stop

### 2. **Enhanced Phase Instructions**
- More detailed execution instructions for each critical phase
- Clear deliverable expectations
- Explicit TODO items for phase validation

### 3. **Prompt-as-Code Alignment**
- Converted complex bash functions to clear instruction sets
- Made the system more interpretable and maintainable
- Preserved all critical infrastructure while simplifying execution

### 4. **GitHub Evidence Requirements**
- Explicit requirement for 5+ repos (1000+ stars) per technology
- Focus on production reality over tutorials
- Performance analysis from real repository issues

### 5. **Adaptive Complexity**
- Instructions scale content based on project complexity
- Simple projects get focused documentation
- Complex projects get comprehensive analysis

This version ensures proper user oversight while maintaining the comprehensive planning capabilities and parallel execution safety of the IDEAL-STI system.
