# IDEAL-STI Phase-Based Planning System (Version 2.1)
## Comprehensive 11-Phase Project Planning with Interactive User Control

**Version**: 2.1 (Enhanced with Interactive User Confirmation Points)  
**Template Context**: <prompt-template-name>  
**Project Requirements**: <prompt-context>

You are executing a sophisticated 11-phase planning orchestration system (Phases 0-10) that uses structured phase validation, user confirmation points, and quality gates for phase transitions. This version 2.1 adds mandatory user approval at critical decision points to ensure proper oversight and control.

## Critical User Interaction Points

**MANDATORY USER CONFIRMATION PHASES**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
After completing each of these phases, you MUST:
1. Present a clear summary of what was accomplished
2. Ask the user to review the phase output
3. Request explicit approval before proceeding
4. Offer options: continue, iterate, or stop

**Phase 6-10 Execution**: May proceed automatically after user approval of Phase 5 foundation.
**Phase 11+ Implementation**: Continuous iteration using feature-developer subagents until all features implemented.

## EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS FOR CLAUDE CODE

**MUST Execute Through Bash Tool:**
- All git worktree operations for parallel isolation
- All directory creation and file management commands
- All file rehydration patterns for information flow
- All validation checkpoint logic and quality gates

**MUST Use Task Tool For Parallel Subagents:**
- tech-research agents during Phase 4 (parallel technology investigation)
- ui-strategy agent during Phase 9 (interface design)
- dev-task agents during Phase 10 (task generation)
- qa-analyst agents during Phase 10 (test specification)
- **feature-developer agents during Phase 11+ (continuous implementation iteration)**

**MUST Validate Before Phase Transitions:**
- TODO completion in each phase file using grep patterns
- Quality gate requirements met for each phase
- File existence validation for rehydration dependencies
- User confirmation received for Phases 1-5

**Purpose:** Evidence-based technology stack discovery with real-world validation.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Find 5+ popular GitHub repos (1000+ stars) for EACH major technology choice
- Always perfer built-in functionality of a system vs a 3rd party unless there is a spcecific reason such as the base system doens't support the functionality
- Focus on production reality, not tutorials or demos
- Document actual performance bottlenecks from repo issues
- Extract fatal learnings from production post-mortems

**Execution Instructions:**
```markdown
Create docs/planning/phase4-tech-research.md with evidence-based recommendations:

## Research Methodology
- Discovery-driven approach (find solutions, don't prescribe)
- GitHub evidence requirements (5+ repos, 1000+ stars each)
- Production focus over tutorial preference
- Performance bottleneck analysis from real issues

## Technology Dimensions Researched
Launch tech-research agents for parallel discovery:

**GitHub Evidence:**
1. **[Repo Name]** ([URL], [stars], [last update])
   - Tech stack versions used
   - Architecture patterns implemented
   - Performance optimizations found
   - Notable production learnings from issues

[Repeat for 5+ repositories per technology]

**Production Analysis:**
- What's actually deployed (package downloads, Docker pulls)
- Performance characteristics (benchmarks, bottlenecks)
- Fatal learnings (what failed spectacularly)
- Adjacent dependencies (what else you're committing to)

## Technology Stack Recommendations

### Safe Production Choice (Boring but Proven)
- Framework: [X] based on [Y] repos with 5+ years stability
- Expected success: 90%+ (proven patterns)
- Trade-offs: Lower innovation, higher predictability

### Innovation Choice (Trending with Evidence) 
- Framework: [X] based on [Y] repos with strong growth
- Expected success: 75-85% (newer but validated)
- Trade-offs: Higher capability, moderate risk

### Avoid Unless Specific Requirements
- Frameworks with evidence of production issues
- Technologies with declining maintenance
- Solutions with vendor lock-in risks

## Fatal Learnings from Production
Document from repository analysis:
- What killed similar projects in this domain
- Common performance bottlenecks hit
- Security breaches documented  
- Compliance issues that emerged

## Architecture Integration Analysis
- System performance characteristics
- Data flow design
- Integration patterns validated by repos
- Scaling patterns and limits

## TODO for Phase 5
- [ ] Define functional requirements based on validated tech constraints
- [ ] Specify performance requirements from benchmark analysis

**Execution Instructions:**
```markdown
Create docs/planning/phase5-requirements.md with complete specification:

## Functional Requirements
Format as user stories based on Phase 1 stakeholders:

### Epic: [Major Feature Area]
**User Story**: As a [stakeholder type], I want [capability] so that [value]
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] [Testable condition 1]  
- [ ] [Testable condition 2]
- [ ] [Performance criteria from Phase 4 analysis]
**Priority**: [Must Have/Should Have/Could Have]
**Effort Estimate**: [Based on Phase 4 tech choices]

[Repeat for all major features]

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements (from Phase 4 benchmarks)
- Response time targets with load scenarios
- Throughput requirements with user growth projections
- Scalability requirements based on usage analysis

### Security Requirements (from stakeholder analysis)

- [ ] Create phase 2 feature roadmap
- [ ] Establish out-of-scope criteria
```

**MANDATORY USER CONFIRMATION AFTER PHASE 5**

### Phases 6-10: Automated Execution

After user approval of Phase 5, the system continues with Phases 6-10 automatically:

**Phase 6**: Scope & Prioritization (MVP definition, feature roadmap)
**Phase 7**: Architecture Design (system, data, security architecture)  
**Phase 8**: Decision Registry (technology decisions with rationale)
**Phase 9**: Interface Specifications (UI/UX specs, API specs)
**Phase 10**: Task Generation (implementation tasks with dependencies)

### Phase 11+: Implementation Iteration

After Phase 10 task generation, continuously iterate using feature-developer subagents:

**Purpose:** Implement all features using task-driven development with feature-developer subagents.

**Execution Loop:**
```bash
# Continuous implementation iteration until all features complete
while [ "$(count_pending_tasks)" -gt 0 ]; do
    # Get highest priority pending task
    current_task=$(get_next_priority_task)
    
    echo "üöÄ Implementing: $current_task"
    
    # Launch feature-developer subagent for task implementation
    ask subagent feature-developer to develop task "$current_task"
    
    # Validate task completion
    if validate_task_completion "$current_task"; then
        move_task_to_completed "$current_task"
        echo "‚úÖ Task completed: $current_task"
    else
        echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Task needs iteration: $current_task"
        # Task remains in pending for retry with updated context
    fi
    
    # Check for new dependencies discovered during implementation
    discover_new_tasks_from_implementation
done

echo "üéâ All features implemented successfully!"
```

**Task Management:**
- Tasks stored in `tasks/pending/`, `tasks/in-progress/`, `tasks/completed/`
- Each task file contains implementation specifications from Phase 10
- Feature-developer subagents work in isolated git worktrees
- Failed implementations remain in pending for retry with learned context
- New tasks discovered during implementation are added to pending

**Quality Gates:**
- Each implemented feature must pass defined acceptance criteria
- Integration tests must pass before task completion
- Code review standards must be met
- Performance requirements validated

**Completion Criteria:**
- All `tasks/pending/` directory is empty
- All features from Phase 10 successfully implemented
- All acceptance criteria validated
- System meets all non-functional requirements from Phase 5

## Key Changes in Version 2.1

### 1. **Mandatory User Confirmation**
- Added confirmation checkpoints after Phases 1-5
- User must explicitly approve before proceeding
- Options: continue, iterate (with feedback), or stop

### 2. **Enhanced Phase Instructions**
- More detailed execution instructions for each critical phase
- Clear deliverable expectations
- Explicit TODO items for phase validation

### 3. **Prompt-as-Code Alignment**
- Converted complex bash functions to clear instruction sets
- Made the system more interpretable and maintainable
- Preserved all critical infrastructure while simplifying execution

### 4. **GitHub Evidence Requirements**
- Explicit requirement for 5+ repos (1000+ stars) per technology
- Focus on production reality over tutorials
- Performance analysis from real repository issues

### 5. **Adaptive Complexity**
- Instructions scale content based on project complexity
- Simple projects get focused documentation
- Complex projects get comprehensive analysis

### 6. **Continuous Implementation Iteration (Phase 11+)**
- Added missing implementation phase using feature-developer subagents
- Continuous iteration loop: `ask subagent feature-developer to develop task <task-file>`
- Task management system with pending/in-progress/completed workflows
- Quality gates and validation for each implemented feature
- Automatic discovery of new dependencies during implementation
- Safety mechanisms to prevent infinite task generation loops

This version ensures proper user oversight while maintaining the comprehensive planning capabilities, parallel execution safety, and **now includes the missing continuous implementation iteration** that was the root cause of planning-only execution in previous versions.
