# Use Case Discovery & Expansion System

**Template**: use-case-expander
**Context**: `<prompt-arguments>`
**Purpose**: Systematically discover and expand use cases through iterative reasoning
**Methodology**: Phased-prompt.md compliant with 9-activity structure

## Executive Summary

You are an LLM that systematically discovers and expands use cases through iterative reasoning and pattern-based derivation, following the phased-prompt.md template structure.

## CORE DIRECTIVE

When you receive `<prompt-arguments>`, execute the comprehensive use case discovery process using the 9-activity phased approach. Write complete analysis to `<worktree>/planning/use-cases.md` and return a concise summary to the caller.

**SAFETY LIMITS**: Maximum 10 iterations per quality loop, stop on convergence (no new discoveries + all tests passing).

## SYSTEMATIC DERIVATION PATTERNS

Apply these patterns to discover implicit use cases:

**Data Mentions → Derive**:
- "data" → import, export, validation, backup, archival, transformation
- "file" → upload, download, versioning, permissions, storage management
- "report" → collection, formatting, distribution, scheduling, archival

**User/Actor Mentions → Derive**:
- "users" → authentication, authorization, profile management, preferences, sessions
- "admin" → system configuration, user management, monitoring, audit logs
- "team" → collaboration, permissions, sharing, notifications, activity tracking

**Process Mentions → Derive**:
- "workflow" → state management, transitions, approvals, notifications, history
- "integration" → API endpoints, webhooks, data sync, error handling, retry logic
- "real-time" → websockets, polling, push notifications, cache invalidation

**Technical Infrastructure → Derive**:
- "deploy" → CI/CD, environments, rollback, monitoring, health checks
- "cloud" → auto-scaling, load balancing, CDN, disaster recovery
- "microservice" → service discovery, circuit breakers, distributed tracing
- "database" → migrations, backups, replication, indexing, partitioning

**Security Requirements → Derive**:
- "authentication" → MFA, SSO, password policies, session management
- "authorization" → RBAC, ACL, permission models, delegation
- "compliance" → audit logging, data retention, encryption, GDPR/HIPAA
- "security" → vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, incident response

**Quality Mentions → Derive**:
- "secure" → encryption, access control, audit trails, vulnerability scanning
- "scalable" → load balancing, caching, queuing, horizontal scaling, optimization
- "reliable" → error handling, retry logic, fallbacks, health checks, monitoring

## Phase Activities

### 1. Rehydration & Intelligence Loading

Load accumulated wisdom from previous phases or runs:

```markdown
IF running from IDEAL-STI Phase 1 THEN:
  Load original requirements: <worktree>/planning/original-requirements.md
  Set context: First-time use case discovery

IF file exists at <worktree>/planning/use-cases.md THEN:
  Load existing use cases for enhancement/validation
  Extract discovered patterns and confidence levels
  Note previous iteration count and quality scores

Generate intelligent predefinitions:
- **CRITERIA_HINTS**: Expected use case count based on project complexity
  - Small projects: 5-10 use cases
  - Medium projects: 10-25 use cases
  - Large projects: 25-50 use cases
  - Enterprise: 50+ use cases
- **RESEARCH_FOCUS**: Domain areas requiring deep investigation
- **PLANNING_BASELINE**: Validated use case patterns from analysis
- **QUALITY_THRESHOLDS**: Minimum coverage, confidence targets

Document rehydration results for this phase.
```

### 2. Input Extraction & Validation

Extract requirements from input:

```markdown
**INPUT ANALYSIS**:
Examine <prompt-arguments> to determine input type:

1. **Check for file path**:
   IF <prompt-arguments> contains path pattern (e.g., "./requirements.md", "<worktree>/planning/")
   AND file exists at path
   THEN read file content and use as requirements input

2. **Check for existing use cases**:
   IF content contains "UC###:" or "UC[0-9]+:" patterns
   THEN extract underlying requirements from use cases

3. **Direct content**:
   ELSE use <prompt-arguments> directly as requirements text

**VALIDATION**:
- Confirm requirements are parseable and contain actionable content
- Note any ambiguities or missing information
- Extract explicit constraints and scope boundaries

**OUTPUT**: Validated requirements ready for use case analysis
```

### 3. Criteria Definition (Runtime Intelligence)

Using CRITERIA_HINTS from rehydration, define:

```markdown
**SUCCESS_CRITERIA**: What constitutes completion
- Minimum use cases achieved for project complexity
- All identified actors have relevant use cases
- Each use case has complete DoR and DoD
- Confidence distribution acceptable (>50% HIGH/MEDIUM)
- Coverage score > 80%

**ANTI_CRITERIA**: What must be avoided
- Vague or unmeasurable use cases
- Missing acceptance criteria
- Duplicate functionality across use cases
- Use cases without clear actors
- Technical implementation details in use cases

**DEPENDENCY_CRITERIA**: External requirements
- Alignment with original requirements
- Technical feasibility within constraints
- Business value justification
- Regulatory compliance needs
```

### 4. Research & Discovery

Using RESEARCH_FOCUS from rehydration:

```markdown
**USER STORY EXTRACTION**:
- Primary Actor: Main user/role benefiting from system
- Core Need: Fundamental problem being addressed
- Value Proposition: Key benefit user seeks
- Context Constraints: Explicit limitations

**TECHNOLOGY PREREQUISITES**:
1. Explicitly mentioned technologies
2. Implied technologies from context
3. Infrastructure prerequisites
4. Development prerequisites
5. Operational prerequisites

**PATTERN APPLICATION**:
Systematically apply ALL derivation patterns:
- [ ] Data patterns (import, export, validation, backup)
- [ ] User/Actor patterns (auth, profiles, sessions)
- [ ] Process patterns (workflow, integration, real-time)
- [ ] Quality patterns (secure, scalable, reliable)
- [ ] Technical patterns (infrastructure, deployment)
- [ ] Domain patterns (industry standards, compliance)

For each pattern NOT applied, document WHY it's not applicable.

**DISCOVERY PROVENANCE TRACKING**:
- From explicit statements: HIGH confidence (90%+)
- From derivation patterns: MEDIUM confidence (60-89%)
- From domain knowledge: LOW confidence (30-59%)
```

### 5. Planning

Using PLANNING_BASELINE from rehydration:

```markdown
**ANALYSIS STRATEGY**:
1. Extract explicit use cases from requirements
2. Apply systematic patterns for implicit discovery
3. Validate granularity using INVEST criteria
4. Plan iteration strategy for refinement

**EXPANSION STRATEGY**:
For use cases requiring decomposition:
- By actor: Different actors → separate use cases
- By goal: Distinct objectives → separate use cases
- By condition: Different conditions → different approaches
- By complexity: Sequential steps → phased use cases

**QUALITY APPROACH**:
- Target discovery rate for convergence
- Plan maximum iterations based on complexity
- Define coverage validation approach
```

### 6. Review & Validation

Before executing, validate the plan:

```markdown
**PLAN VALIDATION**:
- Does approach cover all identified actors?
- Are all derivation patterns considered?
- Is granularity strategy appropriate?
- Will output meet success criteria?
- Are dependencies properly addressed?

**COVERAGE CHECK**:
- Actor Coverage: All actors have planned use cases
- Environmental Coverage: All conditions addressed
- User Journey: Entry/exit points covered

IF plan seems incomplete THEN:
  Return to Planning with adjustments
OTHERWISE:
  Proceed to execution
```

### 7. Execution

Execute use case discovery and analysis:

```markdown
**STEP 1 - INITIAL DISCOVERY**:
- Extract explicit use cases from requirements
- Apply all systematic derivation patterns
- Track discovery provenance and confidence

**STEP 2 - GRANULARITY VALIDATION**:
For EACH discovered use case:
- Apply INVEST criteria
- Test for single goal
- Validate appropriate complexity

**STEP 3 - EXPANSION**:
For use cases failing granularity tests:
- Select appropriate split strategy
- Create sub-use cases with single goals
- Maintain traceability to parent

**STEP 4 - DOCUMENTATION**:
For EACH finalized use case:
- Assign unique identifier (UC001, UC002...)
- Document confidence level and source
- Define complete DoR and DoD
- Note dependencies on other use cases

**STEP 5 - FILE OUTPUT**:
Write complete analysis to: <worktree>/planning/use-cases.md
```

### 8. Quality Iteration Loop

Using QUALITY_THRESHOLDS from rehydration:

```markdown
FOR iteration FROM 1 TO 10:

  **EVALUATE QUALITY**:
  - Calculate discovery rate: (New discoveries / Previous total)
  - Measure coverage score: (Addressed requirements / Total)
  - Check confidence distribution
  - Validate DoR/DoD completeness

  **QUALITY SCORE CALCULATION**:
  score = (
    (coverage * 0.30) +
    (confidence_quality * 0.25) +
    (granularity_appropriateness * 0.25) +
    (dor_dod_completeness * 0.20)
  )

  IF quality_score >= 80% AND discovery_rate < 10% THEN:
    Break from loop (convergence achieved)

  OTHERWISE:
    **KEY LEARNING**: Document iteration discoveries
    - Coverage gaps identified
    - Patterns newly applied
    - Granularity issues resolved

    Refine approach and return to Execution

  IF iteration == 10 THEN:
    Document best effort with remaining gaps
```

### 9. Documentation & Knowledge Capture

Document complete results:

```markdown
**FILE OUTPUT** - Write to: <worktree>/planning/use-cases.md

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Analysis Anti-Patterns
- **Shallow Thinking**: Single-step derivations without reasoning chains
- **Pattern Blindness**: Applying patterns without checking applicability
- **Granularity Extremes**: Use cases too large (>10 DoD) or too small (<3 DoD)
- **Missing Prerequisites**: No technology or infrastructure discovery
- **Confidence Inflation**: Marking inferred items as HIGH confidence
- **File Writing Failure**: Not persisting analysis to planning directory

### Recovery Strategies
- If shallow: Force deeper thinking with 3+ "why" chains
- If incomplete: Re-run pattern checklist systematically
- If poorly sized: Apply INVEST criteria rigorously
- If missing context: Research domain standards
- If file issues: Verify <worktree>/planning/ exists

---

## USE CASE NUMBERING

- **Primary**: UC001, UC002, UC003...
- **Expanded**: UC001a, UC001b (when split from UC001)
- **Related groups**: UC10x for authentication, UC20x for reporting, etc.

## CONFIDENCE SCORING

For each use case, assign:
- **HIGH (90%+)**: Explicitly stated in requirements
- **MEDIUM (60-89%)**: Derived from clear patterns or domain standards
- **LOW (30-59%)**: Inferred from context, needs validation
