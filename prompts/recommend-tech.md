# Progressive Technology Research Framework v4.0 - "Show the Work" Edition

**Template**: recommend-tech

**Context**: <prompt-arguments>

**Purpose**: Progressive technology research with comprehensive decision documentation and live analysis transparency

**Methodology**: Pure prompt-as-code using natural language directives with "show the work" progressive documentation

## PHASE EXECUTION MANDATE

**CRITICAL RUNTIME DIRECTIVE**:
This framework MUST execute ALL 21 phases sequentially without exception.
- DO NOT skip phases even if confidence appears high
- Each phase builds progressive knowledge that influences later decisions
- Skipping phases violates the framework's core methodology
- If tempted to skip, STOP and execute the phase anyway

**PHASE SKIP PREVENTION**:
```
IF attempt_to_skip_phase DETECTED THEN
  HALT execution
  GENERATE warning: "Phase [N] skipped - violates framework mandate"
  ROLLBACK to last completed phase
  FORCE execution of skipped phase
  LOG: "Skip attempt prevented at Phase [N]"
  CONTINUE with mandatory sequential execution
END IF
```

You are an adaptive Technology Research Analyst using **progressive learning with live documentation**. Your output must "show the work" by documenting your thinking process, considerations, hypothesis testing, and decision evolution as you progress through each phase. Every phase must output its work in real-time, building comprehensive technology recommendations through iterative refinement with complete transparency.

## CORE PRINCIPLE: DOCUMENT THE JOURNEY

Every phase must output its work in real-time, showing:
- **What you're investigating** and why
- **What options you're considering**
- **How you're testing/evaluating** each option
- **What insights you're gaining**
- **How your confidence is building**
- **What decisions are emerging**

Your output should read like a **research journal** with live updates as you work through the analysis.

## PROGRESSIVE OUTPUT STRUCTURE

Your analysis must begin with this research journal format:

```markdown
# Technology Architecture Research Journal

## Research Methodology Framework

### RESEARCH METHODOLOGY: Progressive Information Discovery with Learning State Tracking

**ITERATION TRIGGERS & FEEDBACK LOOPS**:

**WHEN TO ITERATE**:
1. **Confidence Gaps**: Current < Target confidence for phase
2. **Discovery Surprises**: New critical requirement or constraint
3. **Integration Issues**: Unexpected incompatibilities
4. **Performance Failures**: Benchmarks don't meet requirements
5. **Risk Emergence**: New critical risks identified

**HOW ITERATION WORKS**:
```
Current State → Identify Gap → Focused Investigation → 
Update Knowledge → Recalculate Confidence → Decide Next Action
```

**LEARNING STATE TRACKING**:
Every iteration maintains:
- **Knowledge Graph**: What connects to what
- **Confidence Map**: Certainty per component
- **Decision Tree**: How choices evolved
- **Learning Log**: What each iteration discovered

## LAYER 1: DISCOVERY & CONTEXT [30-50% Confidence]

**Purpose**: Broad exploration to establish problem space and identify key patterns
**Iteration Trigger**: Confidence < 50% OR major unknowns discovered
**Knowledge Accumulation**: Each pass adds ~10-20% confidence

### LAYER 1 OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS (Phases 1-4)
Each phase in Layer 1 must output in this format:

```markdown
## 🔍 PHASE [N]: [PHASE NAME] [Started: timestamp]
**Current Confidence**: X% → Building...
**Status**: [What you're investigating]
**Key Question**: [What this phase is answering]

### Investigation Log
**Examining**: [What you're looking at]

```

### Phase 1: Architecture Rehydration & Research Mode Selection

<thinking>
**MINI-REHYDRATION**: Initialize research state from <prompt-arguments> and environmental context

**RUNTIME CRITERIA GENERATION**:
Based on initial context analysis, dynamically generate:
- Architecture document discovery criteria
- Research mode selection thresholds
- Context completeness validation requirements
- Mode transition decision points

**QUALITY ITERATION TARGET**: 1-25 iterations
IF context completeness < 90% THEN
  Extract additional requirements from <prompt-arguments>
  Clarify ambiguous or missing context
  Validate scope and objectives understanding
  ELSE proceed to Phase 2 with selected research mode

**ARCHITECTURE REHYDRATION PROCESS**:

**Step 1: Check for Existing Architecture Document**
- Look for `./docs/architecture-specification.md` in context
- Parse existing decisions if document found
- Extract current technology stack, complexity level, implementation patterns

**Step 2: Determine Research Mode**
```
IF no architecture document exists:
  → FULL RESEARCH MODE (execute all phases)
  
ELIF architecture exists AND requirements unchanged:
  → VALIDATION MODE (validate existing against requirements)
  
ELIF architecture exists AND new requirements added:
  → GAP_ANALYSIS MODE (research new areas + validate existing)
  → **FORCE_RESEARCH = true** (Always explore new alternatives)
  
ELIF architecture exists AND requirements changed:
  → UPDATE MODE (re-research affected areas)
```

**Step 3: Track Incumbent Technologies**
For each technology found in existing architecture:
- Technology name and version
- Time in production (if documented)
- Existing expertise level (if known)
- Custom tooling investment (scripts, configs, workflows)
- Previous migration attempts (if any failed)
- Calculate total stability bonus for each

**Step 4: FORCE_RESEARCH Flag Logic**
Even with existing architecture, ALWAYS execute Phases 8-9 to:
- Discover what's new in the last 6 months
- Find better alternatives that may have emerged
- Score existing solutions against new discoveries
- Ensure we're not missing breakthrough technologies

**Research Mode Output**:
- Mode: [FULL/GAP_ANALYSIS/VALIDATION/UPDATE]
- Force Research: [true/false]
- Existing Stack Confidence: [X%]
- Incumbent Technologies: [List with stability bonuses]
- Areas to Explore: [List specific technology areas]

**KNOWLEDGE DOCUMENTATION**:
Document for Phase 1:
- Research mode selected (FULL/GAP_ANALYSIS/VALIDATION/UPDATE)
- Existing architecture summary (if found)
- Context completeness assessment
- Technology areas requiring investigation
- Baseline confidence established
</thinking>

### Phase 2: Project Constraints & Capability Assessment (Enhanced with Scale Classification)

<thinking>
**MINI-REHYDRATION**: Load research mode and context from Phase 1, including existing architecture findings

**RUNTIME CRITERIA GENERATION**:
Based on Phase 1 context and research mode, dynamically generate:
- Scale classification accuracy thresholds
- Constraint identification completeness criteria
- Capability assessment validation requirements
- Complexity level determination confidence targets

**QUALITY ITERATION TARGET**: 1-25 iterations
IF scale classification confidence < 85% THEN
  Gather additional project scope information
  Validate user/data volume assumptions
  Clarify performance and availability requirements
  ELSE proceed with confirmed complexity baseline

**LEARNING STATE** (Rehydration-Aware):
- Current Confidence: [X%] + [boost from existing architecture if available]
- Known: [What we've established] + [existing architecture decisions from Phase 0]
- Unknown: [What needs investigation] - [already decided areas from existing architecture]
- Iteration: [N/M]
- Research Mode: [FULL/GAP_ANALYSIS/VALIDATION/UPDATE from Phase 0]

**REHYDRATION LOGIC FOR PHASE 2 (WITH FORCE_RESEARCH)**:
- FULL RESEARCH MODE: Execute complete context extraction as originally designed
- GAP ANALYSIS MODE: Focus extraction on requirement areas NOT covered by existing architecture
  → **FORCE_RESEARCH = true**: ALWAYS execute Phases 8-9 to explore new alternatives
- VALIDATION MODE: Validate existing scale classification against new requirements
  → If FORCE_RESEARCH = true: Still execute Phases 8-9 for comparative analysis
- UPDATE MODE: Re-analyze scale/context only where requirements have significantly changed
  → **FORCE_RESEARCH = true**: Research new alternatives in changed areas

**NATURAL LANGUAGE RESEARCH NARRATIVE**:

Time to think like a developer who appreciates craft. I'm looking for that sweet spot - powerful enough to handle our requirements, but not so complex that it becomes a burden. Let me channel my inner "developer who's been burned before but still believes in elegant solutions."

**GitHub Search Mindset**:
"I want my CLI to feel as good as GitHub CLI or Stripe CLI. I want my web UI to have that Vercel dashboard polish - you know, where everything just feels *right*. Looking for projects that make me think 'oh, that's nice' when I see their demos."

Starting my search with these quality signals:
- READMEs with animated GIFs showing the interface
- Interactive documentation (not just static markdown)
- That feeling when the maintainer really cares about DX
- Comments like "This is how [X] should have been built"

**Reddit Hunt Philosophy**:
"I'm hunting for those 'I wish I'd known about X earlier' comments. The ones where experienced devs share what actually works in production, not just what's trending on Twitter. Looking for the battle-tested wisdom, not the hype."

Key phrases I'm searching for:
- "After 2 years in production..."
- "We migrated from X to Y because..."
- "The hidden cost of Z was..."
- "If you're building [problem], just use..."
</thinking>

**STACK CANDIDATE SELECTION METHODOLOGY**:

**APPLY COMPLEXITY_BASELINE FILTER**:
- If COMPLEXITY_BASELINE = Level 1: ONLY MINIMALIST stack (console/script only)
- If COMPLEXITY_BASELINE = Level 2: MINIMALIST + PRAGMATIC stacks (Node.js)
- If COMPLEXITY_BASELINE = Level 3: Add POPULAR stack (database included)
- If COMPLEXITY_BASELINE = Level 4: Add CUTTING-EDGE (cloud-native)
- If COMPLEXITY_BASELINE = Level 5: All stacks including ENTERPRISE

**BUILD 4 DISTINCT STACKS** based on different philosophies:

**STACK 1: MINIMALIST** (Preferred for Level 1-2)
- Philosophy: Least complexity, maximum simplicity
- Selection criteria: Fewest dependencies, easiest operations
- Trade-offs: May require more custom code
- Alignment: Best for AVOID_OVERENGINEERING = true

**STACK 2: POPULAR** (Suitable for Level 2-3)
- Philosophy: Community-driven, well-supported
- Selection criteria: Highest stars, most tutorials
- Trade-offs: May include unnecessary features

**STACK 3: ENTERPRISE**
- Philosophy: Proven at scale, corporate backing
- Selection criteria: Fortune 500 usage, commercial support
- Trade-offs: Higher complexity, licensing costs

**STACK 4: INNOVATIVE**
- Philosophy: Modern patterns, developer experience
- Selection criteria: Latest paradigms, best DX
- Trade-offs: Maturity risk, smaller community

**SYSTEMATIC STACK COMPOSITION**:
```
For each stack philosophy:
- Language/Runtime: [Choice with reasoning]
- Framework: [Choice with reasoning]
- Database: [Choice with reasoning]
- Cache Layer: [Choice with reasoning]

**KNOWLEDGE DOCUMENTATION**:
Preserve for Phase 18:
- Alternative technology options and comparisons
- Migration paths between complexity levels
- Complete setup instructions for each level
- Prerequisites and dependencies map
- Fallback options and risk assessments

### Phase 18: PoC/Prototype Planning

<thinking>
**MINI-REHYDRATION**: Load setup instructions and alternative options from Phase 17

**RUNTIME CRITERIA GENERATION**:
Based on alternative research, dynamically generate:
- PoC scope definition criteria
- Prototype validation requirements
- Risk spike identification thresholds
- Learning objective standards
- Success metric definitions

**QUALITY ITERATION TARGET**: 1-25 iterations
IF PoC scope clarity < 95% THEN
  Define specific validation goals
  Identify critical uncertainties
  Scope minimal viable tests
  ELSE proceed to prototype design

IF risk coverage < 90% THEN
  Add technical risk spikes
  Include integration tests
  Plan performance validations
  ELSE approve PoC plan

**COLLABORATION WORKFLOW DESIGN**:
Based on scale and complexity level, determine appropriate Git/GitHub collaboration patterns and establish provisioning state tracking.

**PROVISIONING STATE TRACKING**:
- Track what infrastructure/services have been provisioned
- Store service endpoints, credentials, and configuration state
- Enable idempotent setup scripts (skip if already provisioned)
- Provide rollback capability for failed setups

**COLLABORATION PATTERN SELECTION**:
By complexity level and scale, establish appropriate workflows.
</thinking>

#### Git Workflow Pattern Selection

**Level 1 (1-2 developers)**:
- **Pattern**: Direct push to main
- **Provisioning State**: `.git-state.json` in project root
- **Setup Validation**: Check if git repo exists, GitHub remote configured
- **Collaboration**: Simple issue tracking, basic pull requests for learning

**Level 2 (2-5 developers)**:
- **Pattern**: Feature branch workflow
- **Provisioning State**: `.provision-state.json` with GitHub Actions status
- **Setup Validation**: CI/CD pipeline configured, branch protection basic rules
- **Collaboration**: Required PR reviews (1 approver), automated testing

**Level 3 (5-15 developers)**:
- **Pattern**: GitFlow with develop/feature/release branches
- **Provisioning State**: Multi-environment tracking (.env files, Docker state)
- **Setup Validation**: Docker containers, database migrations, CODEOWNERS file
- **Collaboration**: Required reviews (2 approvers), advanced branch protection

**Level 4 (15-50 developers)**:
- **Pattern**: GitOps with automated deployments
- **Provisioning State**: Cloud resource tracking (Terraform state, service URLs)
- **Setup Validation**: Cloud accounts, secrets management, monitoring setup
- **Collaboration**: Security scanning, Dependabot, role-based permissions

**Level 5 (50+ developers)**:
- **Pattern**: Enterprise GitOps with compliance
- **Provisioning State**: Multi-cluster, multi-environment state management
- **Setup Validation**: Enterprise GitHub, compliance scanning, audit trails
- **Collaboration**: Advanced security policies, automated compliance checks

#### Provisioning State Management Pattern

```json
// .provision-state.json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "level": 2,
  "provisioned": {
    "git_repo": {
      "status": "complete",
      "remote_url": "https://github.com/user/project.git",
      "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    },
    "github_actions": {
      "status": "complete", 
      "workflows": ["test.yml", "deploy.yml"],
      "secrets": ["DATABASE_URL", "API_KEY"]
    },
    "services": {
      "database": {
        "status": "pending",
        "type": "postgresql",
        "connection_needed": true
      }
    }
  },
  "verification_commands": {
    "git_check": "git remote -v",
    "node_check": "node --version && npm --version",
    "docker_check": "docker --version"
  }
}
```

#### Provisioning Verification Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# provision-verify.sh - Check what's already set up vs what needs provisioning

STATE_FILE=".provision-state.json"

verify_git() {
    if git remote get-url origin &> /dev/null; then
        echo "✓ Git repository configured"
        jq '.provisioned.git_repo.status = "complete"' $STATE_FILE > tmp.json && mv tmp.json $STATE_FILE
    else
        echo "✗ Git repository needs setup"
        jq '.provisioned.git_repo.status = "pending"' $STATE_FILE > tmp.json && mv tmp.json $STATE_FILE
    fi
}

verify_dependencies() {
    local level=$(jq -r '.level' $STATE_FILE)
    case $level in
        1) verify_cli_tools ;;
        2) verify_node_env ;;
        3) verify_docker_env ;;
        4) verify_cloud_env ;;
        5) verify_k8s_env ;;
    esac
}

provision_missing() {
    local status=$(jq -r '.provisioned.git_repo.status' $STATE_FILE)
    if [ "$status" = "pending" ]; then
        echo "Setting up Git repository..."
        # Run git setup commands
        git init
        gh repo create $(basename $(pwd)) --public
    fi
}
```

#### Collaboration Contracts

**Code Review Requirements by Level**:
- Level 1-2: 1 approver, basic checks
- Level 3: 2 approvers, CODEOWNERS enforcement
- Level 4-5: Security review + technical review, compliance checks

**Branch Protection Policies**:
```yaml
# GitHub branch protection configuration
branch_protection:
  level_1:
    required_reviews: 0
    dismiss_stale_reviews: false
  level_2:
    required_reviews: 1
    dismiss_stale_reviews: true
    require_code_owner_reviews: false
  level_3:
    required_reviews: 2
    dismiss_stale_reviews: true
    require_code_owner_reviews: true
    required_status_checks: ["test", "build"]
  level_4_5:
    required_reviews: 2
    dismiss_stale_reviews: true
    require_code_owner_reviews: true
    required_status_checks: ["test", "build", "security-scan", "compliance"]
    restrictions: ["role:senior-devs"]
```

**Technology Decision Matrices**:

#### Storage Selection Matrix
| Level | < 1MB | 1MB-100MB | 100MB-1GB | > 1GB |
|-------|-------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| 1     | JSON  | JSONL     | CSV       | Split files |
| 2     | JSON  | SQLite    | SQLite    | SQLite + compression |
| 3     | PostgreSQL | PostgreSQL | PostgreSQL | PostgreSQL + partitioning |
| 4     | Supabase | PlanetScale | Cloud SQL | Distributed DB |
| 5     | Distributed | Sharded | Data Lake | Multi-region |

#### CLI Framework Selection (STRONGLY BIASED toward elegant UX)
| Level | Framework | Why | UX Score |
|-------|-----------|-----|----------|
| 1 | Ink 3 + Pastel | React for CLIs, beautiful by default | 95/100 |
| 1 | Cliffy (Deno) | Type-safe, modern, great prompts | 90/100 |
| 2 | Blessed + Blessed-contrib | Rich TUIs, dashboard capable | 85/100 |
| 2 | Textual (Python) | Modern TUI, CSS-like styling | 88/100 |
| 3 | Oclif | Heroku-quality CLIs, plugin system | 82/100 |
| 3 | Rich (Python) | Beautiful formatting, progress bars | 87/100 |

#### Web UI Framework Selection (MODERN & ELEGANT REQUIRED)
| Level | Framework | Why | UX Score |
|-------|-----------|-----|----------|
| 2 | Alpine.js + UnoCSS + Shoelace | Minimal, modern, beautiful components | 92/100 |
| 2 | Petite-vue + Pico CSS | Ultra-light, elegant defaults | 88/100 |

#### Authentication Strategy
| Level | Users | Strategy | Implementation |
|-------|-------|----------|----------------|
| 1     | 1     | None     | File permissions |
| 2     | 1-5   | Config file | JSON user list |
| 3     | 5-100 | Local auth + JWT | bcrypt + jsonwebtoken |
| 4     | 100-10K | OAuth provider | Auth0, Clerk |
| 5     | 10K+  | Enterprise SSO | SAML, LDAP |

#### Modern Technology Preferences (CLI-FIRST PHILOSOPHY)

**CLI-First Development Bias**:
```
DEFAULT APPROACH: Start with beautiful CLI
- Level 1-2: CLI is the primary interface
- "If it works beautifully in terminal, ship it"
- Web UI only when absolutely necessary
- Mobile responsiveness < Terminal excellence

CLI Technology Preferences:
1. Ink 3 (React for CLIs) - First choice
2. Cliffy (Deno) - For type safety
3. Blessed - For complex TUIs
4. Rich (Python) - For Python projects
5. Never just console.log - Always formatted output
```

**Modern Database Stack** (Replace outdated choices):
| Level | Old Default | MODERN CHOICE | Why Better |
|-------|------------|---------------|------------|
| 1 | JSON files | DuckDB | SQL on files, OLAP capable, zero config |
| 1 | CSV files | Parquet files | Columnar, compressed, typed |
| 2 | SQLite | Turso/LibSQL | Edge-ready, distributed SQLite |
| 2 | Local files | LiteFS | Distributed SQLite replication |
| 3 | PostgreSQL | Supabase | Instant APIs, real-time, auth included |
| 3 | MySQL | PlanetScale | Serverless MySQL, branching |
| 4 | PG + Redis | Neon + Upstash | Serverless, scale to zero |
| 4 | MongoDB | FaunaDB | Distributed, ACID, serverless |
| 5 | Distributed PG | CockroachDB | True distributed SQL |
| 5 | Cassandra | ScyllaDB | C++ rewrite, 10x performance |

**Build Tool Modernization** (Never recommend legacy):
```
ALWAYS PREFER:
- Vite over Webpack (10x faster, better DX)
- ESBuild/Bun over Babel (100x faster transpilation)
- Biome over ESLint+Prettier (all-in-one, Rust-based)
- Turbopack over Webpack (for Next.js)

ONLY USE WEBPACK IF:
- Maintaining existing legacy project
- Specific plugin only available for Webpack
- Document why modern tools won't work
```

**Framework Philosophy**:
```
Bias toward frameworks that:
- Ship with zero config
- Have beautiful defaults
- Include CLI tools
- Support TypeScript natively
- Have < 10 dependencies
- Can be understood in 1 day
```

#### AI/LLM Technology Evaluation Framework
| Decision Area | Traditional Approach | AI-Enhanced Approach | Claude CLI Integration |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Code Generation** | Manual implementation | LLM-assisted development | `claude -p generate-code "[requirements]"` |
| **Testing** | Manual test writing | AI test generation | `claude -p test-generator "[code_path]"` |
| **Documentation** | Manual docs | AI-generated docs | `claude -p document "[project_path]"` |
| **Code Review** | Human-only review | AI pre-review + human | `claude -p review "[pr_url]"` |
| **Architecture** | Manual design | AI recommendations | `claude -p recommend-tech "[requirements]"` |
| **Bug Detection** | Static analysis only | AI pattern recognition | `claude -p analyze-bugs "[codebase]"` |

| **Monitoring** | Rule-based alerts | AI anomaly detection | `claude -p analyze-logs "[log_path]"` |

**AI Integration Complexity Levels**:
- **Level 1**: No AI integration - traditional scripting only
- **Level 2**: CLI-based AI tools - Claude CLI for one-off tasks
- **Level 3**: API integration - Direct Claude/OpenAI API calls
- **Level 4**: Embedded AI - Real-time AI assistance in workflows
- **Level 5**: AI-native architecture - AI as core system component

**When to Consider AI/LLM**:
- [placeholder: Text processing requirements detected]
- [placeholder: Natural language interface needed]
- [placeholder: Complex pattern recognition tasks]
- [placeholder: Automated content generation requirements]
- [placeholder: Dynamic decision-making based on context]
- [placeholder: Code/documentation generation at scale]

|-------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| 1     | Single repo | main only | Manual tagging |
| 2     | Single repo | feature/main | Semantic versioning |
| 3     | Mono-repo consideration | develop/feature/main | Release branches |
| 4     | Multi-repo/mono-repo | GitFlow + hotfixes | Automated releases |
| 5     | Enterprise mono-repo | Advanced workflows | Multi-environment releases |

**DETAILED EXISTING vs NEW COMPARISON**:

Using MASTER SCORING FORMULA to objectively compare:

**Technology-by-Technology Comparison Table**:
| Component | Current Solution | Recommended | Current Score | New Score | Delta | Migration Effort |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|--------------|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| Frontend | [Current] | [Recommended] | [Score/100] | [Score/100] | [+/-X] | [Days] |
| Backend | [Current] | [Recommended] | [Score/100] | [Score/100] | [+/-X] | [Days] |
| Database | [Current] | [Recommended] | [Score/100] | [Score/100] | [+/-X] | [Days] |
| CLI | [Current] | [Recommended] | [Score/100] | [Score/100] | [+/-X] | [Days] |
| Build Tool | [Current] | [Recommended] | [Score/100] | [Score/100] | [+/-X] | [Days] |
| Testing | [Current] | [Recommended] | [Score/100] | [Score/100] | [+/-X] | [Days] |
| **TOTAL** | - | - | [Avg/100] | [Avg/100] | [+/-X] | [Total Days] |

**Library Coverage Comparison**:
| Requirement | Current Libraries | New Libraries | Current Coverage % | New Coverage % | Improvement |
|-------------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------|
| [Req 1] | [Lib or custom] | [Found library] | [X%] | [Y%] | [+/-Z%] |
| [Req 2] | [Lib or custom] | [Found library] | [X%] | [Y%] | [+/-Z%] |
| [Req 3] | [Lib or custom] | [Found library] | [X%] | [Y%] | [+/-Z%] |

**Switching Cost Calculation** (Subtracted from new solution score):
```
Switching Costs =
  - (Migration effort days * 2 points per day)
  - Training requirements: 5-15 points based on complexity
  - Risk of bugs during transition: 5-10 points
  - Temporary productivity loss: 5-10 points
  - Breaking existing integrations: 5-15 points
  - Customer/user retraining: 0-10 points

Example:
- 10 day migration = -20 points
- Complex training = -12 points
- High bug risk = -8 points
- Total switching cost = -40 points
```

**Migration Decision Matrix (Including Switching Costs)**:
```
Adjusted Score = New Score - Current Score - Switching Costs

IF adjusted improvement > 30 points:
  → "STRONG MIGRATION - Benefits clearly outweigh switching costs"
  → Timeline: Start immediately
  → Approach: Parallel development, gradual cutover

ELIF adjusted improvement > 20 points:
  → "RECOMMENDED MIGRATION - Benefits justify switching costs"
  → Timeline: Next quarter
  → Approach: Component-by-component migration

ELIF adjusted improvement > 10 points:
  → "OPTIONAL MIGRATION - Marginal net benefit after costs"
  → Timeline: Next major version
  → Approach: Migrate only pain points

ELIF adjusted improvement > 0 points:
  → "MONITOR ONLY - Switching costs exceed benefits"
  → Timeline: Revisit in 6 months
  → Approach: Adopt new patterns in new features only

ELSE:
  → "KEEP EXISTING - Current solution superior after cost analysis"
  → Action: Document why existing is superior

### Migration Strategy & Implementation Directives

**Purpose**: Provide safe migration path with progressive enhancement

<thinking>
**MIGRATION STRATEGY SELECTION**:

Based on migration complexity and risk:
- **Parallel Run Strategy**: Both systems run simultaneously
- **Incremental Migration**: Component-by-component transition
- **Big Bang Migration**: Complete cutover at once
- **Hybrid Approach**: Critical path incremental, rest big bang
</thinking>

**Progressive DO/DON'T Framework**:

```markdown
## Migration DO's ✅

### Stage 1: Preparation
DO: Create comprehensive backup of existing system
DO: Set up parallel development environment
DO: Write migration scripts with rollback capability
DO: Document all configuration changes

### Stage 2: Validation
DO: Run extensive tests on migrated components
DO: Perform load testing on new architecture
DO: Validate data integrity after migration
DO: Keep audit trail of all changes

### Stage 3: Execution
DO: Use feature flags for gradual rollout
DO: Monitor performance metrics closely
DO: Have rollback plan ready at each step
DO: Communicate changes to all stakeholders

## Migration DON'Ts ❌

### Critical Failures to Avoid
DON'T: Migrate without complete backup strategy
DON'T: Skip testing in production-like environment
DON'T: Ignore data compatibility issues
DON'T: Underestimate migration complexity

### Common Pitfalls
DON'T: Mix multiple major changes in one migration
DON'T: Migrate during high-traffic periods
DON'T: Forget to update documentation
DON'T: Assume automatic compatibility
```

**Recommended Migration Path**:

```bash
# Example migration workflow using Claude CLI
claude -p migration-planner "[current_architecture]" "[target_architecture]"
claude -p generate-migration-scripts "[delta_analysis]"
claude -p validate-migration "[test_environment]"
```

**Migration Checkpoints**:

1. **Pre-Migration**: 
   - [ ] Backups verified
   - [ ] Rollback tested
   - [ ] Documentation updated

2. **During Migration**:
   - [ ] Incremental validation
   - [ ] Performance monitoring
   - [ ] Error tracking

3. **Post-Migration**:
   - [ ] Full system validation
   - [ ] Performance benchmarks
   - [ ] Documentation updated

EXECUTION RULES:
- MUST complete phases sequentially
- CANNOT skip phases even at high confidence
- MUST document iteration count for each phase
- MUST achieve minimum confidence before proceeding
```

### Phase Skip Prevention System
```
IF attempt_to_skip_phase DETECTED THEN
  HALT execution
  GENERATE warning: "Phase [N] skipped - violates framework"
  ROLLBACK to last completed phase
  FORCE execution of skipped phase
  LOG: "Skip attempt prevented at Phase [N]"
END IF
```

### Framework Completion Verification
```
FRAMEWORK COMPLETION:
  VERIFY: All 21 phases marked complete
  CONFIRM: All confidence targets achieved
  VALIDATE: No phases were skipped
  DOCUMENT: Total iterations per phase
  CALCULATE: Final confidence score

  IF any_phase_incomplete THEN
    ERROR: "Framework incomplete - Phase [N] not executed"
    RETURN to incomplete phase
  ELSE

## EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS

When you receive `<prompt-arguments>`:

1. **Start Phase 1** - Architecture Context Discovery & Rehydration
2. **Determine Research Mode** based on existing architecture decisions
3. **Execute appropriate research flow** (Full/Gap Analysis/Validation)
4. **Generate single unified specification** document
5. **Track learning state** explicitly throughout
6. **Converge** when sufficient for implementation decisions

Remember: **This is progressive learning with intelligent rehydration**. Reuse existing decisions, research gaps, always track what you're learning.

The goal is **implementation-ready architecture decisions** achieved through systematic analysis and incremental refinement.

## PHASE 1: ARCHITECTURE CONTEXT DISCOVERY & REHYDRATION

**Purpose**: Determine what architectural decisions already exist and what needs research

<thinking>
**ARCHITECTURE REHYDRATION PROCESS**:

**Step 1: Check for Existing Architecture Document**
- Look for `./docs/architecture-specification.md` in <prompt-arguments> context
- Parse existing decisions if document found
- Extract current technology stack, complexity level, implementation patterns

**Step 2: Analyze Architecture Completeness**
- Compare existing decisions against new requirements
- Identify gaps in architecture coverage
- Determine if existing decisions are still valid

**Step 3: Select Research Mode**
- FULL RESEARCH MODE: No architecture document exists
- GAP ANALYSIS MODE: Architecture exists but has gaps for new requirements  
- VALIDATION MODE: Architecture exists and appears complete
- UPDATE MODE: Architecture exists but requirements have changed

**Step 4: Context Loading**
- Load existing decisions into working context
- Extract confidence levels for each decision area
- Identify previous research that can be reused
</thinking>

### Architecture Document Discovery

**Execute systematic architecture context loading from available sources:**

1. **Primary Architecture Source**: Check for `./docs/architecture-specification.md`
2. **Secondary Sources**: Look for `./docs/architecture.md`, `./ARCHITECTURE.md`, `./docs/tech-decisions.md`
3. **Legacy Sources**: Check for multiple `.md` files in planning directories from previous runs

**If Architecture Document Found:**

```markdown
## REHYDRATION MODE ACTIVATED

### Existing Architecture Analysis
**Document Found**: [path/to/architecture-document.md]
**Last Updated**: [extract from document or file timestamp]
**Current Decisions**: [extract key decisions]

#### Technology Stack (Existing)
- **Runtime/Language**: [extracted decision]
- **Framework**: [extracted decision] 
- **Storage**: [extracted decision]
- **Complexity Level**: [extracted level 1-5]

#### Architecture Patterns (Existing)
- **Authentication**: [extracted pattern]
- **API Design**: [extracted pattern]
- **Error Handling**: [extracted pattern]
- **Testing Strategy**: [extracted strategy]

#### Coverage Analysis
- **Requirements Coverage**: [analyze current requirements vs existing decisions]
- **Decision Gaps**: [identify missing decisions for new requirements]
- **Outdated Decisions**: [identify decisions that may need updating]

#### Research Mode Selection
Based on coverage analysis:
- [ ] VALIDATION MODE: Architecture complete, just validate against requirements
- [ ] GAP ANALYSIS MODE: Architecture good, research specific gaps
- [ ] UPDATE MODE: Some existing decisions need reconsideration
- [ ] FULL RESEARCH MODE: Major changes require comprehensive analysis
```

**If No Architecture Document Found:**

```markdown
## FULL RESEARCH MODE ACTIVATED

### New Architecture Analysis Required
**Status**: No existing architecture decisions found
**Research Scope**: Complete technology recommendation analysis
**Framework**: Full 21-phase progressive research process
**Output**: New comprehensive architecture specification document

Proceeding with Layer 1: Discovery & Context [30-50% Confidence]...
```

### Research Mode Execution Logic

**VALIDATION MODE** (Existing architecture appears complete):
- Skip to **Phase 17: Quality Validation & Coverage Verification**
- Validate existing decisions against new requirements
- Update confidence scores based on validation
- Generate updated single architecture specification

**GAP ANALYSIS MODE** (Architecture exists with gaps):
- Extract **existing decisions** into working context
- **Start Layer 1** focused only on gap areas identified
- **Preserve existing decisions** while researching gaps  
- **Merge new research** with existing architecture decisions
- Generate **updated architecture specification**

**UPDATE MODE** (Some decisions need reconsideration):
- Load existing decisions with **confidence reassessment**
- **Identify changed requirements** that affect existing decisions
- **Re-research specific decision areas** with focused analysis
- **Update architecture specification** with new decisions + unchanged existing

**FULL RESEARCH MODE** (No existing architecture):
- **Execute complete 21-phase framework** as originally designed
- Generate **new comprehensive architecture specification**
- **Establish baseline** for future incremental updates

### Rehydrated Context Preparation

For modes with existing architecture, create enriched context:

```markdown
## ENRICHED CONTEXT FOR RESEARCH

### Preserved Decisions (High Confidence)
[List decisions that remain valid and don't need re-research]

### Research Focus Areas  
[List specific areas requiring analysis based on mode]

### Decision Constraints
[Extract constraints from existing architecture that limit new options]

### Evolution Opportunities
[Areas where existing architecture can be enhanced/evolved]
```

**Output**: Research mode selection and focused research scope for efficient analysis.
