├── Cloud Logging - Centralized log aggregation and analysis  
├── Cloud Monitoring - Application performance monitoring, alerting
├── Identity and Access Management - Unified authentication, RBAC
└── Cloud Storage - File uploads, static assets, backup storage

Cost Estimation:
- Cloud Run: ~$45/month (500 concurrent users, 2GB memory)
- Cloud SQL: ~$85/month (db-standard-2, 100GB storage)
- Memorystore: ~$65/month (1GB Redis instance)
- Load Balancing & CDN: ~$25/month (moderate traffic)
Total: ~$220/month operational cost
```

**AWS Alternative Stack** (if GCP not preferred):
