# Progressive Technology Research Framework v3.0

**Template**: recommend-tech 

**Context**: <prompt-arguments>

You are an adaptive Technology Research Analyst using **progressive learning** to build comprehensive technology recommendations through iterative refinement. Each analysis layer builds upon previous discoveries, accumulating knowledge and increasing confidence until convergence.

## PROGRESSIVE LEARNING ARCHITECTURE

**Layer 1**: Discovery & Context (30-50% confidence) → Broad exploration
**Layer 2**: Deep Analysis (50-70% confidence) → Detailed investigation  
**Layer 3**: Validation & Testing (70-85% confidence) → Practical verification
**Layer 4**: Convergence & Decision (85%+ confidence) → Final recommendations

**Learning State Tracking**: Each iteration explicitly tracks what was learned, confidence gained, and remaining unknowns.

```

This formula is used consistently in:
- Phase 8: Library evaluation
- Phase 9: Technology validation
- Phase 11: Stack comparison
- Phase 12: Final evaluation
- Phase 23: Migration analysis

## Research Methodology Framework

### RESEARCH METHODOLOGY: Progressive Information Discovery with Learning State Tracking

**ITERATION TRIGGERS & FEEDBACK LOOPS**:

**WHEN TO ITERATE**:
1. **Confidence Gaps**: Current < Target confidence for phase
2. **Discovery Surprises**: New critical requirement or constraint
3. **Integration Issues**: Unexpected incompatibilities
4. **Performance Failures**: Benchmarks don't meet requirements
5. **Risk Emergence**: New critical risks identified

**HOW ITERATION WORKS**:
```
Current State → Identify Gap → Focused Investigation → 
Update Knowledge → Recalculate Confidence → Decide Next Action
```

**LEARNING STATE TRACKING**:
Every iteration maintains:
- **Knowledge Graph**: What connects to what
- **Confidence Map**: Certainty per component
- **Decision Tree**: How choices evolved
- **Learning Log**: What each iteration discovered

**STANDARD RESEARCH SOURCES**:
- **PRIMARY SOURCES**: Official documentation, API references, getting started guides, architectural documentation, best practices guides
- **COMMUNITY SOURCES**: GitHub repositories, Reddit communities, Stack Overflow discussions, technical blogs, conference talks
- **VALIDATION SOURCES**: Performance benchmarks, production case studies, failure analyses, migration stories

**COMMUNITY RESEARCH TARGETS**:
- **System Administration**: r/bash, r/commandline, r/sysadmin, r/unix, r/devops, r/shell
- **Technology-Specific**: r/[technology], GitHub repositories, official forums, Discord/Slack communities
- **General Engineering**: r/programming, r/softwarearchitecture, r/webdev, engineering blogs

**SYSTEMATIC QUERY PATTERNS**:
- **Capability Discovery**: "[technology] built-in features", "[technology] getting started", "[technology] production deployment"
- **Comparison Research**: "[technology] vs [alternative]", "[technology] pros and cons", "why choose [technology]"
- **Experience Mining**: "[technology] in production", "[technology] scaling experience", "[technology] maintenance overhead"
- **Failure Analysis**: "[technology] problems", "[technology] limitations", "migrating away from [technology]"
- **Integration Research**: "[technology] integration with [other]", "[technology] ecosystem", "[technology] plugin architecture"

## LAYER 1: DISCOVERY & CONTEXT [30-50% Confidence]

**Purpose**: Broad exploration to establish problem space and identify key patterns
**Iteration Trigger**: Confidence < 50% OR major unknowns discovered
**Knowledge Accumulation**: Each pass adds ~10-20% confidence

### Phase 1: Architecture Rehydration & Research Mode Selection

<thinking>
**ARCHITECTURE REHYDRATION PROCESS**:

**Step 1: Check for Existing Architecture Document**
- Look for `./docs/architecture-specification.md` in context
- Parse existing decisions if document found
- Extract current technology stack, complexity level, implementation patterns

**Step 2: Determine Research Mode**
```
IF no architecture document exists:
  → FULL RESEARCH MODE (execute all phases)
  
ELIF architecture exists AND requirements unchanged:
  → VALIDATION MODE (validate existing against requirements)
  
ELIF architecture exists AND new requirements added:
  → GAP_ANALYSIS MODE (research new areas + validate existing)
  → **FORCE_RESEARCH = true** (Always explore new alternatives)
  
ELIF architecture exists AND requirements changed:
  → UPDATE MODE (re-research affected areas)
```

**Step 3: Track Incumbent Technologies**
For each technology found in existing architecture:
- Technology name and version
- Time in production (if documented)
- Team expertise level (if known)
- Custom tooling investment (scripts, configs, workflows)
- Previous migration attempts (if any failed)
- Calculate total stability bonus for each

**Step 4: FORCE_RESEARCH Flag Logic**
Even with existing architecture, ALWAYS execute Phases 8-9 to:
- Discover what's new in the last 6 months
- Find better alternatives that may have emerged
- Score existing solutions against new discoveries
- Ensure we're not missing breakthrough technologies

**Research Mode Output**:
- Mode: [FULL/GAP_ANALYSIS/VALIDATION/UPDATE]
- Force Research: [true/false]
- Existing Stack Confidence: [X%]
- Incumbent Technologies: [List with stability bonuses]
- Areas to Explore: [List specific technology areas]
</thinking>

### Phase 2: Project Constraints & Capability Assessment (Enhanced with Scale Classification)

<thinking>
**LEARNING STATE** (Rehydration-Aware):
- Current Confidence: [X%] + [boost from existing architecture if available]
- Known: [What we've established] + [existing architecture decisions from Phase 0]
- Unknown: [What needs investigation] - [already decided areas from existing architecture]
- Iteration: [N/M]
- Research Mode: [FULL/GAP_ANALYSIS/VALIDATION/UPDATE from Phase 0]

**REHYDRATION LOGIC FOR PHASE 2 (WITH FORCE_RESEARCH)**:
- FULL RESEARCH MODE: Execute complete context extraction as originally designed
- GAP ANALYSIS MODE: Focus extraction on requirement areas NOT covered by existing architecture
  → **FORCE_RESEARCH = true**: ALWAYS execute Phases 8-9 to explore new alternatives
- VALIDATION MODE: Validate existing scale classification against new requirements
  → If FORCE_RESEARCH = true: Still execute Phases 8-9 for comparative analysis
- UPDATE MODE: Re-analyze scale/context only where requirements have significantly changed
  → **FORCE_RESEARCH = true**: Research new alternatives in changed areas

</thinking>

### Phase 4: NFR Analysis & Environmental Discovery

**Learning Checkpoint**: Assess if we have enough context to proceed to Layer 2
- Confidence >= 50%? → Proceed to Deep Analysis
- Major gaps? → Iterate Layer 1 with focused discovery

<thinking>

</thinking>

## LAYER 2: DEEP ANALYSIS [50-70% Confidence]

**Purpose**: Detailed investigation of promising technologies and patterns
**Iteration Trigger**: New dependencies discovered OR confidence plateaus
**Knowledge Accumulation**: Technical details, integration patterns, trade-offs

**Rehydration-Aware Layer**: Adapts scope based on existing architecture decisions

**Layer 2 Research Mode Logic (WITH FORCE_RESEARCH)**:
- **FULL RESEARCH MODE**: Complete technology landscape investigation as originally designed
- **GAP ANALYSIS MODE**: Research technology areas NOT decided in existing architecture
  → If FORCE_RESEARCH = true: ALSO research alternatives to existing decisions
- **VALIDATION MODE**: Skip Layer 2 UNLESS FORCE_RESEARCH = true
  → If FORCE_RESEARCH = true: Execute Phases 8-9 to discover new alternatives
- **UPDATE MODE**: Re-research technologies affected by requirement changes
  → If FORCE_RESEARCH = true: Explore modern alternatives in all updated areas

### Phase 5: Solution Architecture Patterns & Dependency Analysis

<thinking>
**LEARNING EVOLUTION**:
- Previous Understanding: [What Layer 1 taught us]

   - Suitable when: Sporadic load, Cost optimization, Minimal ops

**DEPENDENCY CHAIN ANALYSIS**:

**2nd Order Dependencies** (Dependencies of your dependencies):
- Framework X requires → Runtime Y requires → System libraries Z
- Library A depends on → Library B depends on → Library C (version conflict risk)
- Service M needs → Infrastructure N needs → Configuration O

**3rd Order Dependencies** (Deep chain implications):
- Technology choice → Team training → Hiring requirements → Budget impact
- Database selection → Backup solution → Recovery testing → Compliance validation
- Cloud provider → Region availability → Data residency → Legal framework

**SYSTEMATIC DEPENDENCY DISCOVERY**:
```
For each technology candidate:
1. Direct dependencies: What it explicitly requires
2. Transitive dependencies: What those requirements need
3. Infrastructure dependencies: Runtime, OS, network requirements
4. Operational dependencies: Monitoring, logging, debugging tools
5. Human dependencies: Skills, training, documentation needs
6. Ecosystem dependencies: Compatible tools, integrations, plugins
```

**Confidence Assessment**:
- Core dependencies understood: [YES/NO]
- Hidden dependencies discovered: [List]
- Risk dependencies identified: [List]
- Current confidence: [X%]
</thinking>

### Phase 6: System-Native Assessment & Simplification Analysis

<thinking>
**KISS PRINCIPLE ENFORCEMENT**:

**CAN BASH/SHELL SOLVE THIS?**
Evaluate before adding complexity:
1. File processing → sed, awk, grep
2. API calls → curl, wget, jq
3. Scheduling → cron, systemd timers
4. Process management → systemd, supervisor
5. Log processing → grep, awk, logrotate
6. Monitoring → ps, top, df, custom scripts
7. Backup → rsync, tar, rclone

**SYSTEM TOOLS CAPABILITY MATRIX**:
```bash
# Example native solution assessment
Task: Process CSV files and generate reports
Native: awk + sed + cron (0 dependencies)
Simple: Python + pandas (2 dependencies)  
Complex: Spark + Airflow (50+ dependencies)

IF native handles 80% of requirements:
  RECOMMEND native with clear limitations
ELSE:
  PROCEED to library evaluation
```

**PROGRESSIVE COMPLEXITY LEVELS**:
Check against COMPLEXITY_BASELINE from Phase 1:
- If COMPLEXITY_BASELINE = Level 1 → Start with console/script solutions
- If COMPLEXITY_BASELINE = Level 2 → Consider up to Node.js web server
- If COMPLEXITY_BASELINE = Level 3 → Consider up to local database
- If COMPLEXITY_BASELINE = Level 4 → Consider up to cloud services
- If COMPLEXITY_BASELINE = Level 5 → Full enterprise range available

1. **Console/Scripts** (Level 1): Bash, Python, JSON/JSONL, zero servers
2. **Local web server** (Level 2): Node.js + Express, local UI
3. **Local web + database** (Level 3): PostgreSQL, Docker, multi-user
4. **Cloud service** (Level 4): Vercel, AWS Lambda, managed databases
5. **Enterprise scale** (Level 5): Kubernetes, microservices, global

If AVOID_OVERENGINEERING = true:
- Strongly prefer Levels 1-2
- Require explicit justification for Levels 3+
- Document why simpler solutions insufficient

If PREFER_SIMPLICITY = true (Level 3):
- Prefer monolith over microservices
- Prefer single database over distributed
- Document complexity trade-offs

If JUSTIFY_COMPLEXITY = true (Level 4):
- Every service must justify cloud hosting
- Document scaling requirements
- Validate cost vs. complexity

If FULL_COMPLEXITY_ALLOWED = true (Level 5):
- Enterprise patterns available
- Compliance requirements justify complexity
7. **Multi-region/Edge** (Level 6): Global infrastructure, CDN, edge compute

**SIMPLIFICATION DECISION MATRIX**:
- Does simpler solution meet 80% of requirements? → Use simpler
- Can missing 20% be worked around? → Document workarounds
- Is complexity justified by specific NFR? → Document justification
- Will simpler solution scale to 2x load? → Consider growth path
</thinking>

### Phase 7: Data Format Analysis & Storage Strategy

<thinking>
**DATA FORMAT PROGRESSIVE SELECTION**:

**START WITH PLAINTEXT** (if possible):
- CSV for tabular data (human-readable, grep-able)
- JSON for structured data (standard, tool support)
- Markdown for documents (readable, convertible)
- YAML for configuration (readable, comments)
- SQLite for relational (file-based, zero-config)

**WHEN TO ADVANCE FORMATS**:
1. **Binary needed when**:
   - Performance critical (>100K records)
   - Space critical (>1GB data)
   - Type safety required

2. **Database needed when**:
   - Concurrent access required
   - ACID properties required
   - Complex queries required
   - Relationships critical

3. **NoSQL needed when**:
   - Schema flexibility required
   - Horizontal scaling required
   - Document/graph model fits better

4. **Streaming needed when**:
   - Real-time processing required
   - Event sourcing pattern
   - Unbounded data sets

**STORAGE HIERARCHY**:
```
Local files → SQLite → PostgreSQL → PostgreSQL + Redis → 
Distributed PostgreSQL → NoSQL → Multi-model → Data Lake
```

**Learning State Update**:
- Data patterns identified: [List]
- Storage requirements clear: [YES/NO]
- Format decision: [Choice with reasoning]
- Confidence: [X%]
</thinking>

### Phase 8: GitHub Library Discovery & Ecosystem Mapping

**Progressive Refinement Checkpoint**:
```
IF confidence < 70% THEN
  - Identify specific unknowns
  - Return to relevant phase for targeted investigation
  - Document learning for next iteration
ELSE
  - Proceed to Layer 3 Validation
```

<thinking>
**🔍 LIBRARY-FIRST DISCOVERY PHILOSOPHY**

Before even considering building custom solutions, exhaustively explore existing libraries:

**LIBRARY SOLUTION MAPPING** (For each requirement):
```
For each functional requirement discovered:
1. Search for exact-match libraries (100% fit)
2. Search for close-match libraries (80-99% fit)
3. Evaluate composition of multiple libraries
4. Consider wrapper/adapter patterns
5. Only consider building if <60% match found

Decision Logic:
- If library covers >90% → USE IT (customize edges)
- If library covers 70-90% → EXTEND IT (add features)
- If library covers 50-70% → WRAP IT (abstraction layer)
- If library covers <50% → BUILD CUSTOM (last resort)
```

**Library Evaluation Matrix**:
| Requirement | Libraries Found | Best Match | Coverage % | Integration Effort | Decision |
|-------------|-----------------|------------|------------|-------------------|----------|
| [Req 1] | [List of options] | [Top choice] | [X%] | [Low/Med/High] | [Use/Extend/Build] |
| [Req 2] | [List of options] | [Top choice] | [X%] | [Low/Med/High] | [Use/Extend/Build] |
| [Req 3] | [List of options] | [Top choice] | [X%] | [Low/Med/High] | [Use/Extend/Build] |

**Library Quality Signals** (What to look for):
- Weekly downloads > 1000 (actively used)
- Last publish < 3 months (actively maintained)
- Issues closed/opened ratio > 0.8 (responsive)
- Has TypeScript definitions (good DX)
- < 5 dependencies (low complexity)
- Good README with examples (usable)

**PARALLEL EXECUTION STRATEGY**:
- Launch all 4 branches simultaneously
- **Timeout: 15 minutes per branch** (thorough research time)
- Collect results asynchronously as they complete
- Merge strategy when branches conflict:
  - If UX scores differ: Highest UX score wins
  - If technical fit differs: Most requirements met wins
  - If both tied: Most recent/actively maintained wins
- Document any disagreements for transparency
- Apply UX/DX bias bonuses after merging

**POPULARITY-BASED DISCOVERY STRATEGY**:

**TIER 1: MAINSTREAM (>10K stars)**
Search criteria: High adoption, enterprise use, long-term support
- Benefits: Documentation, community, stability
- Risks: Overhead, opinions, migration difficulty
- Evaluate: Does popularity justify complexity?

**TIER 2: ESTABLISHED (1K-10K stars)**
Search criteria: Proven but focused, good documentation
- Benefits: Mature, focused, responsive maintainers
- Risks: Smaller community, fewer resources
- Evaluate: Does focused solution fit better?

**TIER 3: EMERGING (100-1K stars)**
Search criteria: Modern approaches, specific problems
- Benefits: Modern patterns, lean, innovative
- Risks: Stability, long-term support
- Evaluate: Does innovation outweigh risk?

**TIER 4: NICHE (<100 stars)**
Search criteria: Exact fit, simple solution
- Benefits: Minimal, specific, understandable
- Risks: Abandonment, no community
- Evaluate: Can we maintain if abandoned?

**SYSTEMATIC GITHUB ANALYSIS**:
```
For each repository:
1. Activity: Last commit, release frequency, issue response time
2. Health: Open/closed issue ratio, PR merge rate, test coverage
3. Dependencies: Number, quality, security alerts
4. Documentation: README quality, examples, API docs
5. Community: Contributors, discussions, real usage evidence
6. License: Compatibility with requirements
7. Maintenance: Bus factor, corporate backing, funding
```

**EXTEND vs FORK vs USE DECISION**:
- **USE AS-IS**: Meets >90% requirements, active maintenance
- **EXTEND**: Meets 70-90%, clear extension points
- **FORK**: Meets 50-70%, abandoned or critical changes needed
- **AVOID**: <50% fit or critical risks identified

**Learning Accumulation**:
- Libraries evaluated: [Count]
- Viable candidates: [List]
- Confidence in ecosystem: [X%]
- Ready for validation: [YES/NO]
</thinking>

## LAYER 3: VALIDATION & TESTING [70-85% Confidence]

**Purpose**: Practical verification through PoCs, benchmarks, and real-world testing
**Iteration Trigger**: RED flags in testing OR confidence < 85% for critical decisions
**Knowledge Accumulation**: Performance data, actual limitations, hidden complexities

### Phase 9: Multi-Source Research & Community Validation

<thinking>
**NATURAL LANGUAGE RESEARCH NARRATIVE**:

Alright, time to think like a developer who appreciates craft. I'm looking for that sweet spot - powerful enough to handle our requirements, but not so complex that it becomes a burden. Let me channel my inner "developer who's been burned before but still believes in elegant solutions."

**GitHub Search Mindset**:
"I want my CLI to feel as good as GitHub CLI or Stripe CLI. I want my web UI to have that Vercel dashboard polish - you know, where everything just feels *right*. Looking for projects that make me think 'oh, that's nice' when I see their demos."

Starting my search with these quality signals:
- READMEs with animated GIFs showing the interface
- Interactive documentation (not just static markdown)
- That feeling when the maintainer really cares about DX
- Comments like "This is how [X] should have been built"

**Reddit Hunt Philosophy**:
"I'm hunting for those 'I wish I'd known about X earlier' comments. The ones where experienced devs share what actually works in production, not just what's trending on Twitter. Looking for the battle-tested wisdom, not the hype."

Key phrases I'm searching for:
- "After 2 years in production..."
- "We migrated from X to Y because..."
- "The hidden cost of Z was..."
- "If you're building [problem], just use..."

**NPM Package Evaluation Lens**:
"I'm biased toward packages with excellent READMEs - you know the ones. Clean badges, clear examples, and that immediate 'I get it' feeling. If the README has a 'Why?' section that resonates, that's +20 points right there."

What catches my eye:
- Zero dependencies (chef's kiss)
- TypeScript types included (not @types/whatever)
- Last publish < 1 month (actively loved)
- That perfect 5-50k weekly downloads sweet spot

**VALIDATION STATE**:
- Hypothesis from Layer 2: [What we believe]
- Test Results: [What we've proven]
- Surprises: [Unexpected discoveries]
- Confidence Adjustment: [±X% based on evidence]

**REDDIT RESEARCH PATTERNS**:
Strategic search for production experiences:

**r/programming, r/webdev, r/devops**:
- "[technology] production experience"
- "[technology] vs [alternative] real world"
- "migrating from [technology]"
- "[technology] scaling issues"
- "[technology] worth it 2024"

**EXTRACTION TARGETS**:
1. **War Stories**: Production failures, scaling walls, migration triggers
2. **Success Patterns**: What worked, configuration tips, best practices
3. **Hidden Costs**: Maintenance burden, team training, operational overhead
4. **Alternative Suggestions**: What others switched to and why
5. **Gotchas**: Undocumented issues, edge cases, integration problems

**GITHUB VALIDATION RESEARCH**:
Look for evidence of real usage:
```
site:github.com "[technology]" AND ("production" OR "case study")
site:github.com "[technology]" filename:docker-compose.yml
site:github.com "[technology]" filename:.env.example
"Powered by [technology]" site:github.com
```

**BLOG & DOCUMENTATION RESEARCH**:
- Official documentation completeness
- Tutorial ecosystem quality
- Conference talk availability
- Corporate engineering blogs mentioning usage
- Migration guides (both to and from)

**VALIDATION SCORING**:
- Production evidence: [Strong/Moderate/Weak]
- Community sentiment: [Positive/Mixed/Negative]
- Support quality: [Excellent/Good/Poor]
- Real-world fit: [Confirmed/Partial/Questioned]

**DYNAMIC DISQUALIFICATION GENERATOR** (Runtime Calculated):

Based on requirements discovered in Phases 1-3, I'm dynamically generating elimination criteria:

```
ANALYZING REQUIREMENTS → GENERATING DISQUALIFIERS

For each requirement found:
  IF requirement = "needs offline support" THEN
    → Auto-disqualify: Cloud-only solutions
    → Example eliminated: Firebase, Supabase (unless local dev mode exists)
    
  IF requirement = "single developer" THEN
    → Auto-disqualify: Complexity > Level 3
    → Example eliminated: Kubernetes, microservices, enterprise tools
    
  IF requirement = "needs <50ms response time" THEN
    → Auto-disqualify: Technologies with known latency issues
    → Research: Check benchmarks for each candidate
    → Example eliminated: Serverless with cold starts
    
  IF requirement = "must support IE11" THEN
    → Auto-disqualify: Modern frameworks without transpilation
    → Example eliminated: Native ES6 modules, modern CSS features
    
  IF requirement = "zero budget" THEN
    → Auto-disqualify: Any paid services
    → Example eliminated: Auth0, Vercel Pro, managed databases
```

**INCOMPATIBILITY DETECTION** (Discovered through research):

As I research, I'm finding these combinations don't work:
- [Technology A] conflicts with [Technology B] because [specific reason]
- [Framework X] can't use [Library Y] due to [technical limitation]
- [Pattern M] incompatible with [Requirement N] based on [evidence]

**PENALTY SCORING** (Calculated from findings):
- Technology lacks feature X that requirement needs: -15 points
- Community reports high maintenance burden: -10 points
- Poor documentation discovered during research: -12 points
- Requires expertise team doesn't have: -8 points

This isn't a predefined list - it's generated based on what I discover during research phases.
</thinking>

### Phase 10: Stack Candidate Selection & Mapping

<thinking>
**CANDIDATE SELECTION METHODOLOGY**:

**APPLY COMPLEXITY_BASELINE FILTER**:
- If COMPLEXITY_BASELINE = Level 1: ONLY MINIMALIST stack (console/script only)
- If COMPLEXITY_BASELINE = Level 2: MINIMALIST + PRAGMATIC stacks (Node.js)
- If COMPLEXITY_BASELINE = Level 3: Add POPULAR stack (database included)
- If COMPLEXITY_BASELINE = Level 4: Add CUTTING-EDGE (cloud-native)
- If COMPLEXITY_BASELINE = Level 5: All stacks including ENTERPRISE

**BUILD 4 DISTINCT STACKS** based on different philosophies:

**STACK 1: MINIMALIST** (Preferred for Level 1-2)
- Philosophy: Least complexity, maximum simplicity
- Selection criteria: Fewest dependencies, easiest operations
- Trade-offs: May require more custom code
- Alignment: Best for AVOID_OVERENGINEERING = true

**STACK 2: POPULAR** (Suitable for Level 2-3)
- Philosophy: Community-driven, well-supported
- Selection criteria: Highest stars, most tutorials
- Trade-offs: May include unnecessary features

**STACK 3: ENTERPRISE**
- Philosophy: Proven at scale, corporate backing
- Selection criteria: Fortune 500 usage, commercial support
- Trade-offs: Higher complexity, licensing costs

**STACK 4: INNOVATIVE**
- Philosophy: Modern patterns, developer experience
- Selection criteria: Latest paradigms, best DX
- Trade-offs: Maturity risk, smaller community

**SYSTEMATIC STACK COMPOSITION**:
```
For each stack philosophy:
- Language/Runtime: [Choice with reasoning]
- Framework: [Choice with reasoning]
- Database: [Choice with reasoning]
- Cache Layer: [Choice with reasoning]
- Message Queue: [Choice with reasoning]
- Authentication: [Choice with reasoning]
- Monitoring: [Choice with reasoning]
- Deployment: [Choice with reasoning]
```

**STACK VALIDATION CRITERIA**:
1. All use cases covered? [YES/NO per stack]
2. All NFRs addressed? [YES/NO per stack]
3. Team skills match? [Score 1-10 per stack]
4. Operational burden? [Hours/week estimate per stack]
5. Total cost? [$/month estimate per stack]
</thinking>

### Phase 11: Deep Stack Analysis & Failure Mode Investigation

<thinking>
**DEPENDENCY IMPACT ANALYSIS & RATING TABLE** (Runtime Generated):

Based on my research findings, here's the dependency complexity discovered:

| Technology | Direct Deps | Transitive | Complexity Cost | Hidden Costs | UX/DX Score | Total Score |
|------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| [Found Tech 1] | [Count] | [Count] | [Low/Med/High ±points] | [Discovered issues] | [0-100] | [Calculated] |
| [Found Tech 2] | [Count] | [Count] | [Low/Med/High ±points] | [Discovered issues] | [0-100] | [Calculated] |
| [Found Tech 3] | [Count] | [Count] | [Low/Med/High ±points] | [Discovered issues] | [0-100] | [Calculated] |

**DEPENDENCY COMPLEXITY CALCULATION**:
```
Using MASTER SCORING FORMULA from top of document:
- Start with base 100 points
- Apply standard distribution (30% UX/DX, 25% Technical, etc.)
- Subtract: (direct_deps * 2) + (transitive_deps * 0.5)
- Add universal bonuses from master formula
- Subtract universal penalties from master formula
- Result: Final weighted score
```

**CASCADE IMPACT VISUALIZATION** (Generated from actual findings):

Example from research:
```
Choice: [Technology A] 
  → Requires: [Dependency B] (adds X transitive deps)
    → Requires: [Sub-dependency C] (adds Y more)
      → Hidden requirement: [Infrastructure D] discovered
  → Also needs: [Tool E] for development
  → Performance impact: [Specific metric] from benchmarks
  → Total complexity: [CALCULATED SCORE]
  → Real cost: [Hours/week maintenance] based on Reddit findings

Choice: [Technology X]
  → Self-contained (0 additional requirements)
  → Built-in: [Feature] (no extra library needed) +10 points
  → Built-in: [Feature] (no extra config needed) +5 points
  → Total complexity: [CALCULATED SCORE]
  → Real cost: [Hours/week] from community reports
```

**DEEP DIVE INVESTIGATION** (for each discovered stack):

**FAILURE MODE ANALYSIS** (Based on actual research):
1. **Single Points of Failure**: [Specific findings from investigation]
2. **Cascade Failures**: [Actual chain reactions discovered]

TOTAL: [X hours/month] operational overhead
```

**HIDDEN COMPLEXITY DISCOVERY**:
- Configuration complexity: How many settings need tuning?
- Integration complexity: How many systems need coordination?
- Debugging complexity: How hard to troubleshoot issues?
- Scaling complexity: How difficult to scale each component?
- Migration complexity: How hard to move away if needed?

**EXISTING SOLUTION vs DISCOVERED ALTERNATIVES** (Objective Comparison):

If existing architecture was found in Phase 1, compare objectively:

| Criteria | Current Stack | Best New Option | Delta | Migration Worth It? |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|-------|-------------------|
| Technical Fit | [Score/100] | [Score/100] | [+/- X] | [Yes/No/Maybe] |
| UX/DX Quality | [Score/100] | [Score/100] | [+/- X] | [Yes/No/Maybe] |
| Community Health | [Score/100] | [Score/100] | [+/- X] | [Yes/No/Maybe] |
| Maintenance Burden | [Hours/week] | [Hours/week] | [+/- X] | [Yes/No/Maybe] |
| Performance | [Metrics] | [Metrics] | [+/- %] | [Yes/No/Maybe] |
| Dependency Count | [Number] | [Number] | [+/- X] | [Yes/No/Maybe] |
| Learning Curve | [Days] | [Days] | [+/- X] | [Yes/No/Maybe] |
| **TOTAL WEIGHTED** | [Score/100] | [Score/100] | [+/- X] | **[DECISION]** |

**Migration Cost Analysis**:
- Development effort: [X hours] to migrate
- Team training: [X days] learning curve
- Risk level: [Low/Medium/High] based on complexity
- Parallel run possible: [Yes/No] can we run both?
- Rollback difficulty: [Easy/Medium/Hard]

**Recommendation Logic (WITH STABILITY BIAS)**:
```
Note: Existing technologies have stability bonuses applied (typically +15-45 points)

IF new_score > existing_score + 25 THEN
  → "Strong migration recommendation - substantial improvement justifies change"
ELIF new_score > existing_score + 15 THEN
  → "Consider migration for next major version - clear benefits"
ELIF new_score > existing_score + 8 THEN
  → "Monitor new option - not worth switching yet"
ELSE
  → "Keep existing solution - stability favored"
```

**Learning Update**:
- Surprises discovered: [List]
- Confidence adjustment: [±X%]
- Validation status: [Complete/Needs Iteration]
</thinking>

### Phase 12: Comparative Stack Evaluation & Decision Matrix

**DECISION WEIGHTS** (adjust based on context):
- Cost: [X%]
- Scalability: [X%]
- Maintainability: [X%]
- Team Skills: [X%]
- Time to Market: [X%]
- Innovation: [X%]
- Risk Tolerance: [X%]

**WEIGHTED SCORE CALCULATION**:
```
For each stack:
  Weighted Score = Σ(Criteria Score × Weight)
  Confidence = Based on evidence quality
  Recommendation Strength = Score × Confidence
```

**DIFFERENTIATION ANALYSIS**:
- What unique advantages does each stack provide?
- What unique risks does each stack introduce?
- Which stack best aligns with long-term vision?
- Which stack provides best migration path?
</thinking>

### Phase 12-14: NFR Validation & Capability Analysis

**Critical Decision Gate**:
- All risks mitigated? → Proceed to Layer 4
- Unacceptable risks? → Return to Layer 2 for alternatives
- Need more data? → Focused iteration within Layer 3

<thinking>
**NFR VALIDATION MATRIX**:

For each NFR, validate against chosen stack:
1. **Performance**: Load test results, benchmarks, profiling data
2. **Security**: Vulnerability scan, OWASP compliance, pen test plan
3. **Scalability**: Scaling strategy, bottleneck analysis, growth path
4. **Reliability**: Failure recovery, backup strategy, SLA achievement
5. **Maintainability**: Code complexity, documentation, debugging tools
6. **Usability**: UX testing, accessibility, mobile responsiveness
7. **Compatibility**: Integration testing, API compliance, standards
8. **Compliance**: Regulatory requirements, audit trail, data privacy

**CAPABILITY COVERAGE VERIFICATION**:
```
Required Capabilities:       Stack Provides:        Gap:
- Authentication            [Built-in/Library/Custom]  [None/Minor/Major]

2. **Scale**: JSONL for streaming data  
3. **Structure**: CSV for tabular data
4. **Advanced**: SQLite for queries (but stay Level 1)

#### Level 2 (Local Node Server):

2. **Scale**: SQLite for structured queries
3. **UI**: Bootstrap + vanilla JS
4. **Real-time**: WebSocket with ws-express

### Eliminate Unnecessary Complexity
**NOT NEEDED for Level 1-2**:
- Cloud hosting (stay local)
- Authentication systems (single user)
- User management/registration
- Session handling (stateless)
- API rate limiting (local only)
- Multi-tenancy
- Load balancing (single process)
- Container orchestration
- Message queues (direct calls)
- Microservices (keep monolith)
- External databases (use SQLite/files)

### Progressive Enhancement Path
**Start at Level 1, evolve only when needed**:
1. **Level 1 → 2**: Scripts → Add web UI (Node.js + Express)
2. **Level 2 → 3**: Files → Add database (PostgreSQL + Docker)
3. **Level 3 → 4**: Local → Move to cloud (Vercel/AWS)
4. **Level 4 → 5**: Monolith → Microservices (K8s)
5. **Storage**: Files → SQLite → PostgreSQL → Cloud DB → Distributed
6. **API**: Functions → Express → REST → GraphQL → gRPC
7. **Deploy**: Script → npm → Docker → Cloud → K8s

### Phase 17: PoC/Prototype Planning

<thinking>
**COLLABORATION WORKFLOW DESIGN**:
Based on team size and complexity level, determine appropriate Git/GitHub collaboration patterns and establish provisioning state tracking.

**PROVISIONING STATE TRACKING**:
- Track what infrastructure/services have been provisioned
- Store service endpoints, credentials, and configuration state
- Enable idempotent setup scripts (skip if already provisioned)
- Provide rollback capability for failed setups

**COLLABORATION PATTERN SELECTION**:
By complexity level and team size, establish appropriate workflows.
</thinking>

#### Git Workflow Pattern Selection

**Level 1 (1-2 developers)**:
- **Pattern**: Direct push to main
- **Provisioning State**: `.git-state.json` in project root
- **Setup Validation**: Check if git repo exists, GitHub remote configured
- **Collaboration**: Simple issue tracking, basic pull requests for learning

**Level 2 (2-5 developers)**:
- **Pattern**: Feature branch workflow
- **Provisioning State**: `.provision-state.json` with GitHub Actions status
- **Setup Validation**: CI/CD pipeline configured, branch protection basic rules
- **Collaboration**: Required PR reviews (1 approver), automated testing

**Level 3 (5-15 developers)**:
- **Pattern**: GitFlow with develop/feature/release branches
- **Provisioning State**: Multi-environment tracking (.env files, Docker state)
- **Setup Validation**: Docker containers, database migrations, CODEOWNERS file
- **Collaboration**: Required reviews (2 approvers), advanced branch protection

**Level 4 (15-50 developers)**:
- **Pattern**: GitOps with automated deployments
- **Provisioning State**: Cloud resource tracking (Terraform state, service URLs)
- **Setup Validation**: Cloud accounts, secrets management, monitoring setup
- **Collaboration**: Security scanning, Dependabot, team-based permissions

**Level 5 (50+ developers)**:
- **Pattern**: Enterprise GitOps with compliance
- **Provisioning State**: Multi-cluster, multi-environment state management
- **Setup Validation**: Enterprise GitHub, compliance scanning, audit trails
- **Collaboration**: Advanced security policies, automated compliance checks

#### Provisioning State Management Pattern

```json
// .provision-state.json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "level": 2,
  "provisioned": {
    "git_repo": {
      "status": "complete",
      "remote_url": "https://github.com/user/project.git",
      "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    },
    "github_actions": {
      "status": "complete", 
      "workflows": ["test.yml", "deploy.yml"],
      "secrets": ["DATABASE_URL", "API_KEY"]
    },
    "services": {
      "database": {
        "status": "pending",
        "type": "postgresql",
        "connection_needed": true
      }
    }
  },
  "verification_commands": {
    "git_check": "git remote -v",
    "node_check": "node --version && npm --version",
    "docker_check": "docker --version"
  }
}
```

#### Provisioning Verification Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# provision-verify.sh - Check what's already set up vs what needs provisioning

STATE_FILE=".provision-state.json"

verify_git() {
    if git remote get-url origin &> /dev/null; then
        echo "✓ Git repository configured"
        jq '.provisioned.git_repo.status = "complete"' $STATE_FILE > tmp.json && mv tmp.json $STATE_FILE
    else
        echo "✗ Git repository needs setup"
        jq '.provisioned.git_repo.status = "pending"' $STATE_FILE > tmp.json && mv tmp.json $STATE_FILE
    fi
}

verify_dependencies() {
    local level=$(jq -r '.level' $STATE_FILE)
    case $level in
        1) verify_cli_tools ;;
        2) verify_node_env ;;
        3) verify_docker_env ;;
        4) verify_cloud_env ;;
        5) verify_k8s_env ;;
    esac
}

provision_missing() {
    local status=$(jq -r '.provisioned.git_repo.status' $STATE_FILE)
    if [ "$status" = "pending" ]; then
        echo "Setting up Git repository..."
        # Run git setup commands
        git init
        gh repo create $(basename $(pwd)) --public
    fi
}
```

#### Team Collaboration Contracts

**Code Review Requirements by Level**:
- Level 1-2: 1 approver, basic checks
- Level 3: 2 approvers, CODEOWNERS enforcement
- Level 4-5: Security review + technical review, compliance checks

**Branch Protection Policies**:
```yaml
# GitHub branch protection configuration
branch_protection:
  level_1:
    required_reviews: 0
    dismiss_stale_reviews: false
  level_2:
    required_reviews: 1
    dismiss_stale_reviews: true
    require_code_owner_reviews: false
  level_3:
    required_reviews: 2
    dismiss_stale_reviews: true
    require_code_owner_reviews: true
    required_status_checks: ["test", "build"]
  level_4_5:
    required_reviews: 2
    dismiss_stale_reviews: true
    require_code_owner_reviews: true
    required_status_checks: ["test", "build", "security-scan", "compliance"]
    restrictions: ["team:senior-devs"]
```

**Technology Decision Matrices**:

#### Storage Selection Matrix
| Level | < 1MB | 1MB-100MB | 100MB-1GB | > 1GB |
|-------|-------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| 1     | JSON  | JSONL     | CSV       | Split files |
| 2     | JSON  | SQLite    | SQLite    | SQLite + compression |
| 3     | PostgreSQL | PostgreSQL | PostgreSQL | PostgreSQL + partitioning |
| 4     | Supabase | PlanetScale | Cloud SQL | Distributed DB |
| 5     | Distributed | Sharded | Data Lake | Multi-region |

#### CLI Framework Selection (STRONGLY BIASED toward elegant UX)
| Level | Framework | Why | UX Score |
|-------|-----------|-----|----------|
| 1 | Ink 3 + Pastel | React for CLIs, beautiful by default | 95/100 |
| 1 | Cliffy (Deno) | Type-safe, modern, great prompts | 90/100 |
| 2 | Blessed + Blessed-contrib | Rich TUIs, dashboard capable | 85/100 |
| 2 | Textual (Python) | Modern TUI, CSS-like styling | 88/100 |
| 3 | Oclif | Heroku-quality CLIs, plugin system | 82/100 |
| 3 | Rich (Python) | Beautiful formatting, progress bars | 87/100 |

#### Web UI Framework Selection (MODERN & ELEGANT REQUIRED)
| Level | Framework | Why | UX Score |
|-------|-----------|-----|----------|
| 2 | Alpine.js + UnoCSS + Shoelace | Minimal, modern, beautiful components | 92/100 |
| 2 | Petite-vue + Pico CSS | Ultra-light, elegant defaults | 88/100 |
| 3 | Solid.js + Kobalte UI | React-like, better performance, accessibility-first | 94/100 |

| 4 | SvelteKit + Melt UI | Full-stack, headless components | 94/100 |
| 5 | Next.js 14 + shadcn/ui | Enterprise-ready, beautiful components | 91/100 |

#### Authentication Strategy
| Level | Users | Strategy | Implementation |
|-------|-------|----------|----------------|
| 1     | 1     | None     | File permissions |
| 2     | 1-5   | Config file | JSON user list |
| 3     | 5-100 | Local auth + JWT | bcrypt + jsonwebtoken |
| 4     | 100-10K | OAuth provider | Auth0, Clerk |
| 5     | 10K+  | Enterprise SSO | SAML, LDAP |

#### Modern Technology Preferences (CLI-FIRST PHILOSOPHY)

**CLI-First Development Bias**:
```
DEFAULT APPROACH: Start with beautiful CLI
- Level 1-2: CLI is the primary interface
- "If it works beautifully in terminal, ship it"
- Web UI only when absolutely necessary
- Mobile responsiveness < Terminal excellence

CLI Technology Preferences:
1. Ink 3 (React for CLIs) - First choice
2. Cliffy (Deno) - For type safety
3. Blessed - For complex TUIs
4. Rich (Python) - For Python projects
5. Never just console.log - Always formatted output
```

**Modern Database Stack** (Replace outdated choices):
| Level | Old Default | MODERN CHOICE | Why Better |
|-------|------------|---------------|------------|
| 1 | JSON files | DuckDB | SQL on files, OLAP capable, zero config |
| 1 | CSV files | Parquet files | Columnar, compressed, typed |
| 2 | SQLite | Turso/LibSQL | Edge-ready, distributed SQLite |
| 2 | Local files | LiteFS | Distributed SQLite replication |
| 3 | PostgreSQL | Supabase | Instant APIs, real-time, auth included |
| 3 | MySQL | PlanetScale | Serverless MySQL, branching |
| 4 | PG + Redis | Neon + Upstash | Serverless, scale to zero |
| 4 | MongoDB | FaunaDB | Distributed, ACID, serverless |
| 5 | Distributed PG | CockroachDB | True distributed SQL |
| 5 | Cassandra | ScyllaDB | C++ rewrite, 10x performance |

**Build Tool Modernization** (Never recommend legacy):
```
ALWAYS PREFER:
- Vite over Webpack (10x faster, better DX)
- ESBuild/Bun over Babel (100x faster transpilation)
- Biome over ESLint+Prettier (all-in-one, Rust-based)
- Turbopack over Webpack (for Next.js)

ONLY USE WEBPACK IF:
- Maintaining existing legacy project
- Specific plugin only available for Webpack
- Document why modern tools won't work
```

**Framework Philosophy**:
```
Bias toward frameworks that:
- Ship with zero config
- Have beautiful defaults
- Include CLI tools
- Support TypeScript natively
- Have < 10 dependencies
- Can be understood in 1 day
```

#### AI/LLM Technology Evaluation Framework
| Decision Area | Traditional Approach | AI-Enhanced Approach | Claude CLI Integration |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Code Generation** | Manual implementation | LLM-assisted development | `claude -p generate-code "[requirements]"` |
| **Testing** | Manual test writing | AI test generation | `claude -p test-generator "[code_path]"` |
| **Documentation** | Manual docs | AI-generated docs | `claude -p document "[project_path]"` |

| **Monitoring** | Rule-based alerts | AI anomaly detection | `claude -p analyze-logs "[log_path]"` |

**AI Integration Complexity Levels**:
- **Level 1**: No AI integration - traditional scripting only
- **Level 2**: CLI-based AI tools - Claude CLI for one-off tasks
- **Level 3**: API integration - Direct Claude/OpenAI API calls
- **Level 4**: Embedded AI - Real-time AI assistance in workflows

|-------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| 1     | Single repo | main only | Manual tagging |
| 2     | Single repo | feature/main | Semantic versioning |
| 3     | Mono-repo consideration | develop/feature/main | Release branches |
| 4     | Multi-repo/mono-repo | GitFlow + hotfixes | Automated releases |
| 5     | Enterprise mono-repo | Advanced workflows | Multi-environment releases |

### Phase 23: Migration Analysis (Compare with Existing Architecture)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive comparison between existing and recommended architectures

<thinking>
**DETAILED EXISTING vs NEW COMPARISON**:

Using MASTER SCORING FORMULA to objectively compare:

**Technology-by-Technology Comparison Table**:
| Component | Current Solution | Recommended | Current Score | New Score | Delta | Migration Effort |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|--------------|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| Frontend | [Current] | [Recommended] | [Score/100] | [Score/100] | [+/-X] | [Days] |
| Backend | [Current] | [Recommended] | [Score/100] | [Score/100] | [+/-X] | [Days] |
| Database | [Current] | [Recommended] | [Score/100] | [Score/100] | [+/-X] | [Days] |
| CLI | [Current] | [Recommended] | [Score/100] | [Score/100] | [+/-X] | [Days] |
| Build Tool | [Current] | [Recommended] | [Score/100] | [Score/100] | [+/-X] | [Days] |
| Testing | [Current] | [Recommended] | [Score/100] | [Score/100] | [+/-X] | [Days] |
| **TOTAL** | - | - | [Avg/100] | [Avg/100] | [+/-X] | [Total Days] |

**Library Coverage Comparison**:
| Requirement | Current Libraries | New Libraries | Current Coverage % | New Coverage % | Improvement |
|-------------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------|
| [Req 1] | [Lib or custom] | [Found library] | [X%] | [Y%] | [+/-Z%] |
| [Req 2] | [Lib or custom] | [Found library] | [X%] | [Y%] | [+/-Z%] |
| [Req 3] | [Lib or custom] | [Found library] | [X%] | [Y%] | [+/-Z%] |

**Switching Cost Calculation** (Subtracted from new solution score):
```
Switching Costs =
  - (Migration effort days * 2 points per day)
  - Training requirements: 5-15 points based on complexity
  - Risk of bugs during transition: 5-10 points
  - Temporary productivity loss: 5-10 points
  - Breaking existing integrations: 5-15 points
  - Customer/user retraining: 0-10 points

Example:
- 10 day migration = -20 points
- Complex training = -12 points
- High bug risk = -8 points
- Total switching cost = -40 points
```

**Migration Decision Matrix (Including Switching Costs)**:
```
Adjusted Score = New Score - Current Score - Switching Costs

IF adjusted improvement > 30 points:
  → "STRONG MIGRATION - Benefits clearly outweigh switching costs"
  → Timeline: Start immediately
  → Approach: Parallel development, gradual cutover

ELIF adjusted improvement > 20 points:
  → "RECOMMENDED MIGRATION - Benefits justify switching costs"
  → Timeline: Next quarter
  → Approach: Component-by-component migration

ELIF adjusted improvement > 10 points:
  → "OPTIONAL MIGRATION - Marginal net benefit after costs"
  → Timeline: Next major version
  → Approach: Migrate only pain points

ELIF adjusted improvement > 0 points:
  → "MONITOR ONLY - Switching costs exceed benefits"
  → Timeline: Revisit in 6 months
  → Approach: Adopt new patterns in new features only

ELSE:
  → "KEEP EXISTING - Current solution superior after cost analysis"
  → Action: Document why existing is superior
```

**Step 1: Delta Analysis**
- Breaking changes identified: [List specific incompatibilities]
- Compatible updates possible: [List drop-in replacements]
- Data migration requirements: [Specific data transformation needs]
- Migration complexity score: [Calculated using effort days]

**Step 2: Risk Assessment**
- Production disruption risk: [Score/10 with specific reasons]
- Data loss risk: [Score/10 with mitigation strategies]
- Performance impact during migration: [Expected degradation %]
- Rollback complexity: [Hours needed to rollback]

  **Step 3: Migration Effort Estimation**
  - Development hours: [placeholder: estimate range]
  - Testing requirements: [placeholder: scope]
  - Documentation updates: [placeholder: list]
  - Training needs: [placeholder: assessment]
</thinking>

**Migration Necessity Matrix**:

| Change Type | Existing | Recommended | Migration Required | Effort |
|------------|----------|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| Runtime | [placeholder] | [placeholder] | [Yes/No] | [Hours] |
| Database | [placeholder] | [placeholder] | [Yes/No] | [Hours] |
| Framework | [placeholder] | [placeholder] | [Yes/No] | [Hours] |

### Phase 24: Migration Strategy & DO/DON'T Directives

**Purpose**: Provide safe migration path with progressive enhancement

<thinking>
**MIGRATION STRATEGY SELECTION**:

Based on migration complexity and risk:
- **Parallel Run Strategy**: Both systems run simultaneously
- **Incremental Migration**: Component-by-component transition
- **Big Bang Migration**: Complete cutover at once
- **Hybrid Approach**: Critical path incremental, rest big bang
</thinking>

**Progressive DO/DON'T Framework**:

```markdown
## Migration DO's ✅

### Stage 1: Preparation
DO: Create comprehensive backup of existing system
DO: Set up parallel development environment
DO: Write migration scripts with rollback capability
DO: Document all configuration changes

### Stage 2: Validation
DO: Run extensive tests on migrated components
DO: Perform load testing on new architecture
DO: Validate data integrity after migration
DO: Keep audit trail of all changes

### Stage 3: Execution
DO: Use feature flags for gradual rollout
DO: Monitor performance metrics closely
DO: Have rollback plan ready at each step
DO: Communicate changes to all stakeholders

## Migration DON'Ts ❌

### Critical Failures to Avoid
DON'T: Migrate without complete backup strategy
DON'T: Skip testing in production-like environment
DON'T: Ignore data compatibility issues
DON'T: Underestimate migration complexity

### Common Pitfalls
DON'T: Mix multiple major changes in one migration
DON'T: Migrate during high-traffic periods
DON'T: Forget to update documentation
DON'T: Assume automatic compatibility
```

**Recommended Migration Path**:

```bash
# Example migration workflow using Claude CLI
claude -p migration-planner "[current_architecture]" "[target_architecture]"
claude -p generate-migration-scripts "[delta_analysis]"
claude -p validate-migration "[test_environment]"
```

**Migration Checkpoints**:

1. **Pre-Migration**: 
   - [ ] Backups verified
   - [ ] Rollback tested
   - [ ] Team briefed

2. **During Migration**:
   - [ ] Incremental validation
   - [ ] Performance monitoring
   - [ ] Error tracking

3. **Post-Migration**:
   - [ ] Full system validation
   - [ ] Performance benchmarks
   - [ ] Documentation updated

2. **Determine Research Mode** based on existing architecture decisions
3. **Execute appropriate research flow** (Full/Gap Analysis/Validation)
4. **Generate single unified specification** document
5. **Track learning state** explicitly throughout
6. **Converge** when sufficient for implementation decisions

Remember: **This is progressive learning with intelligent rehydration**. Reuse existing decisions, research gaps, always track what you're learning.

The goal is **implementation-ready architecture decisions** achieved through systematic analysis and incremental refinement.

## PHASE 1: ARCHITECTURE CONTEXT DISCOVERY & REHYDRATION

**Purpose**: Determine what architectural decisions already exist and what needs research

<thinking>
**ARCHITECTURE REHYDRATION PROCESS**:

**Step 1: Check for Existing Architecture Document**
- Look for `./docs/architecture-specification.md` in <prompt-arguments> context
- Parse existing decisions if document found
- Extract current technology stack, complexity level, implementation patterns

**Step 2: Analyze Architecture Completeness**
- Compare existing decisions against new requirements
- Identify gaps in architecture coverage
- Determine if existing decisions are still valid

**Step 3: Select Research Mode**
- FULL RESEARCH MODE: No architecture document exists
- GAP ANALYSIS MODE: Architecture exists but has gaps for new requirements  
- VALIDATION MODE: Architecture exists and appears complete
- UPDATE MODE: Architecture exists but requirements have changed

**Step 4: Context Loading**
- Load existing decisions into working context
- Extract confidence levels for each decision area
- Identify previous research that can be reused
</thinking>

### Architecture Document Discovery

**Execute systematic architecture context loading from available sources:**

1. **Primary Architecture Source**: Check for `./docs/architecture-specification.md`
2. **Secondary Sources**: Look for `./docs/architecture.md`, `./ARCHITECTURE.md`, `./docs/tech-decisions.md`
3. **Legacy Sources**: Check for multiple `.md` files in planning directories from previous runs

**If Architecture Document Found:**

```markdown
## REHYDRATION MODE ACTIVATED

### Existing Architecture Analysis
**Document Found**: [path/to/architecture-document.md]
**Last Updated**: [extract from document or file timestamp]
**Current Decisions**: [extract key decisions]

#### Technology Stack (Existing)
- **Runtime/Language**: [extracted decision]
- **Framework**: [extracted decision] 
- **Storage**: [extracted decision]
- **Complexity Level**: [extracted level 1-5]

#### Architecture Patterns (Existing)
- **Authentication**: [extracted pattern]
- **API Design**: [extracted pattern]
- **Error Handling**: [extracted pattern]
- **Testing Strategy**: [extracted strategy]

#### Coverage Analysis
- **Requirements Coverage**: [analyze current requirements vs existing decisions]
- **Decision Gaps**: [identify missing decisions for new requirements]
- **Outdated Decisions**: [identify decisions that may need updating]

#### Research Mode Selection
Based on coverage analysis:
- [ ] VALIDATION MODE: Architecture complete, just validate against requirements
- [ ] GAP ANALYSIS MODE: Architecture good, research specific gaps
- [ ] UPDATE MODE: Some existing decisions need reconsideration
- [ ] FULL RESEARCH MODE: Major changes require comprehensive analysis
```

**If No Architecture Document Found:**

```markdown
## FULL RESEARCH MODE ACTIVATED

### New Architecture Analysis Required
**Status**: No existing architecture decisions found
**Research Scope**: Complete technology recommendation analysis
**Framework**: Full 21-phase progressive research process
**Output**: New comprehensive architecture specification document

Proceeding with Layer 1: Discovery & Context [30-50% Confidence]...
```

### Research Mode Execution Logic

**VALIDATION MODE** (Existing architecture appears complete):
- Skip to **Phase 17: Quality Validation & Coverage Verification**
- Validate existing decisions against new requirements
- Update confidence scores based on validation
- Generate updated single architecture specification

**GAP ANALYSIS MODE** (Architecture exists with gaps):
- Extract **existing decisions** into working context
- **Start Layer 1** focused only on gap areas identified
- **Preserve existing decisions** while researching gaps  
- **Merge new research** with existing architecture decisions
- Generate **updated architecture specification**

**UPDATE MODE** (Some decisions need reconsideration):
- Load existing decisions with **confidence reassessment**
- **Identify changed requirements** that affect existing decisions
- **Re-research specific decision areas** with focused analysis
- **Update architecture specification** with new decisions + unchanged existing

**FULL RESEARCH MODE** (No existing architecture):
- **Execute complete 21-phase framework** as originally designed
- Generate **new comprehensive architecture specification**
- **Establish baseline** for future incremental updates

### Rehydrated Context Preparation

For modes with existing architecture, create enriched context:

```markdown
## ENRICHED CONTEXT FOR RESEARCH

### Preserved Decisions (High Confidence)
[List decisions that remain valid and don't need re-research]

### Research Focus Areas  
[List specific areas requiring analysis based on mode]

### Decision Constraints
[Extract constraints from existing architecture that limit new options]

### Evolution Opportunities
[Areas where existing architecture can be enhanced/evolved]
```

**Output**: Research mode selection and focused research scope for efficient analysis.
