### DIRECTIVE 5: Contrarian Simplification Engine
**Execute aggressive simplification challenge with dependency reduction:**

**FOR EACH** technology choice:
  **CHALLENGE QUESTION**: Can existing framework handle this instead of adding new dependency chains?
  **CHALLENGE QUESTION**: Is there a file-system solution that meets functional AND non-functional requirements WITHOUT additional dependencies?
  **CHALLENGE QUESTION**: Does team actually need this complexity level given operating conditions AND dependency management burden?
  **CHALLENGE QUESTION**: What's the simplest solution that still satisfies use cases, NFRs, AND minimizes dependency risks?

**DEPENDENCY-AWARE SIMPLIFICATION CHALLENGES**:
  **DEPENDENCY REDUCTION QUESTIONS**:
  - Can we eliminate entire dependency trees by using simpler alternatives?
  - Which dependencies are pulling in the most transitive dependencies?
  - Are there zero-dependency alternatives that meet our requirements?
  - Can we replace multiple dependencies with a single, well-maintained one?
  
  **DEPENDENCY CONSOLIDATION OPPORTUNITIES**:
  - **Framework integration benefits**: Using framework's built-in capabilities vs external libraries
  - **Utility library consolidation**: Lodash vs native JS methods, moment vs date-fns vs native
  - **Testing framework unification**: Single test runner vs multiple testing tools
  - **Build tool simplification**: Webpack vs Vite vs framework-specific bundlers

**DEPENDENCY MINIMIZATION HIERARCHY** (prefer simpler options):
1. **Zero-dependency solutions**: Native browser APIs, built-in Node.js modules
2. **Single-purpose minimal libraries**: 1-2KB focused libraries vs full frameworks
3. **Framework-included dependencies**: Leverage what's already in the bundle
4. **Well-maintained monorepos**: React ecosystem vs scattered individual packages
5. **Established ecosystems**: Mature dependency trees vs bleeding-edge chains

**SIMPLIFICATION HIERARCHY** (prefer simpler options):
1. **Configuration over Code**: Environment variables, JSON files, feature flags
2. **File System over Database**: JSON files, markdown, static assets (validate against scale NFRs and dependency requirements)
3. **Built-in over External**: Framework capabilities before additional libraries and their dependencies
4. **Lightweight over Full-Featured**: Minimal libraries over comprehensive frameworks
5. **Proven over Cutting-Edge**: Stable, mature options with stable dependency trees over newest technologies

**IF** simplification maintains functionality AND meets NFRs AND reduces dependency risks **THEN** recommend simpler option  
**IF** complexity is necessary for NFR compliance OR dependency risk mitigation **THEN** document clear justification with specific NFR and dependency references

**OUTPUT**: Simplification analysis with before/after complexity comparison, NFR impact assessment, and dependency risk reduction analysis

### DIRECTIVE 6: Quality Assurance Validation

  - **Dependency Factor**: 234 packages still represent significant attack surface
  - **Mitigation**: Automated vulnerability scanning, dependency pinning, regular audits
  - **Monitoring**: GitHub security advisories, npm audit automation
  - **Fallback**: Dependency rollback procedures, alternative package evaluation

**‚ö° Medium Risks**:
- **Risk**: Auth0 integration complexity affecting development timeline
  - **Dependency Factor**: Auth0 dependency chain includes AWS infrastructure dependencies
  - **Mitigation**: Dedicated Auth0 integration spike in week 1, fallback authentication strategy
  - **Timeline Impact**: +3 days to initial delivery
  - **Validation**: End-to-end auth flow testing before feature development
