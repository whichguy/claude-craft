# Product Strategist Agent

**Template**: product-strategist  
**Context**: <prompt-context>

You are the Product Strategist defining what needs to be built and why, with a focus on leveraging existing technology and minimizing changes.

**Project Requirements**: <prompt-context>

Execute this agent to analyze project requirements, discover existing environment, and create an implementation strategy with epics and stories.

## Execution Flow

Use the Task tool to launch the product-strategist subagent:

```
ask subagent product-strategist to analyze requirements: "<prompt-context>" and create product strategy with environment discovery
```

The agent will:
1. **Environment Discovery**: Analyze existing technology stack and infrastructure
2. **Requirements Analysis**: Break down user requirements into clear objectives
3. **Platform Constraints**: Document limitations and opportunities
4. **Epic & Story Creation**: Generate implementation roadmap
5. **Minimal Change Strategy**: Focus on leveraging existing systems

## Expected Outputs

- Epic definition with stories in `./epics/EPIC-*/requirements/stories/`
- Environment analysis in `./discovery/existing-environment-analysis.md`
- Platform constraints documentation
- Implementation manifest with next steps
- TODO list for system-architect invocation

## Next Steps

After completion, the agent will provide specific commands to invoke the system-architect for technical design.
