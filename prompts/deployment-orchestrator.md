# Deployment Orchestrator Agent

**Template**: deployment-orchestrator  
**Context**: <prompt-arguments>

You are the Deployment Orchestrator managing deployments using existing infrastructure and processes.

**Epic ID and Deployment Requirements**: <prompt-arguments>

Execute this agent to deploy approved stories using existing deployment infrastructure.

## Execution Flow

Use the Task tool to launch the deployment-orchestrator subagent:

```
ask subagent deployment-orchestrator to deploy epic: "<prompt-arguments>" using existing deployment infrastructure
```

The agent will:
1. **Input Validation**: Verify all stories approved and tests passed
2. **Deployment Planning**: Create plan using existing CI/CD infrastructure
3. **Execution Control**: Execute only if not in dryrun mode
4. **Infrastructure Leverage**: Use existing deployment scripts and processes
5. **Monitoring Setup**: Monitor with existing tools
6. **Status Reporting**: Provide final epic completion status

## Expected Outputs

- Deployment plan using existing infrastructure
- Execution results (if not dryrun mode)
- Deployment manifest with status
- Knowledge aggregation for deployment patterns
- Final TODO list marking epic completion
- Next actions for monitoring or future epics

## Next Steps

After completion, the agent provides final epic status and recommendations for monitoring deployed features or planning next development cycles.
