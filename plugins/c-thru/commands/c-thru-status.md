# c-thru Status
Run the list command. It shows: active profile, all 20 agents with model assignments and endpoints,
proxy URL with tier/mode, Ollama model count, backend health, and per-model usage stats
(call count, total tokens, timestamp of last call).

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty or `--verbose`, run:
```bash
~/.claude/tools/c-thru --list $ARGUMENTS
```
