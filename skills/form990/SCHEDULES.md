# Form 990 Skill — Schedule Playbooks

Dispatched from PHASES.md §P6. Each schedule generates:
1. A human-readable `artifacts/schedule-<letter>.md` narrative + worksheet
2. Entries in `artifacts/form990-dataset-schedules.json` under `schedules.<letter>`

---

## Schedule A — Public Support Test (always for 501(c)(3) non-PF)

**Purpose.** Document the organization's public charity status by proving it passes the
5-year public support test (or explaining how it qualifies under a different basis).

**When triggered.** Always for 501(c)(3) organizations that are not private foundations.

### Sub-phase: Gather 5-Year Support Data

Collect support history for years T, T-1, T-2, T-3, T-4 (where T = current tax year):
- Public contributions (Part VIII Line 1 total) for each year
- Government grants (Part VIII Line 1e) for each year
- Program service revenue for each year
- Investment income for each year
- Total support for each year

If prior-year 990s are available in `artifacts`: read directly.
If not: create Open Questions for years T-1 through T-4 (ask bookkeeper/prior CPA).

### 509(a)(1) / §170(b)(1)(A)(vi) Public Support Worksheet

```
For each year y in [T-4, T-3, T-2, T-1, T]:
  total_contributions[y]  = Part VIII Line 1 for year y
  govt_grants[y]          = Part VIII Line 1e for year y
  total_support[y]        = all revenue for year y (contributions + program fees +
                             investment income + other)
  donor_threshold[y]      = 0.02 × sum(total_support[T-4..T])   ← 2% of 5-yr total support
  
  excess_contributions[y] = sum over all donors d:
                              max(0, donor_contributions[d][y] − donor_threshold[y])

5yr_public_support = sum([total_contributions[y] − excess_contributions[y] for y in window])
5yr_total_support  = sum([total_support[y] for y in window])

public_support_pct = 5yr_public_support / 5yr_total_support × 100
```

**Thresholds:**
- `≥ 33⅓%` → PASS bright-line test → check box Line 5 of Schedule A Part II
- `≥ 10% AND < 33⅓%` → may still pass if facts-and-circumstances narrative is attached
  (community support, board diversity, etc.)  → check box Line 6 of Schedule A Part II
- `< 10%` → FAILS 509(a)(1) test → check if 509(a)(2) applies instead; if not, flag Q-F4
  NEEDS_UPDATE

### 509(a)(2) Worksheet (if public_charity_basis == "509(a)(2)")

```
5yr_program_service_pct = sum(program_service_revenue[T-4..T]) / 5yr_total_support × 100
5yr_investment_pct      = sum(investment_income[T-4..T]) / 5yr_total_support × 100

PASS if: 5yr_program_service_pct ≥ 33⅓%
  AND:   5yr_investment_pct       ≤ 33⅓%
```

### Facts-and-Circumstances Narrative (if 10%–33⅓%)

Draft a Schedule O narrative covering (per Reg. §1.170A-9(f)(3)):
1. Organization's relationship to governmental units or to the general public
2. Nature of the governing body (community board?)
3. Programs' accessibility to and for the general public
4. Resources solicited from the general public, government, or broad public appeal
5. Community use of facilities or services on a non-discriminatory basis

## Schedule B — Schedule of Contributors

**Purpose.** List contributors who gave ≥ $5,000 (or ≥ 2% of total contributions, whichever
is greater) during the tax year. Confidential — not for public inspection.

**When triggered.** Part IV question about large contributions (typically Part IV Line 2).

### Two-Output Contract (IRC §6104(d)(3)(A))

**Public inspection version** (`artifacts/schedule-b-public.md`):
- Contributor names → `"Anonymous"`

- Type → retained
- Safe for public inspection copy, website, VCS

**Security check:** verify `artifacts/schedule-b-filing.md` path is in `.gitignore` before
writing. If not found in `.gitignore`: add it and breadcrumb the addition.

### Threshold Calculation

```
total_contributions = Part VIII Line 1 sum
threshold = max(5000, 0.02 × total_contributions)

reportable_contributors = [d for d in donor_list if d.amount >= threshold]
```

For each reportable contributor: list Part I (name, address, total contribution, type).

- Reference the specific Part + Line (e.g., "Schedule O re: Part VI, Line 6 — How are
  voting members of the governing body elected or selected?")
- Provide a substantive narrative (not just a sentence)

### Standard Sections (always include for most organizations):

**Functional Expense Allocation Methodology** (Q-F17):
```
Part VI, Line 6 — [Board election process]
Part VI, Line 11b — [Review process for Form 990 prior to filing]
Part VI, Line 12a — [Conflict-of-interest policy description]
Part VI, Line 12b — [How COI policy is monitored]
Part VI, Line 12c — [How COI policy is enforced]
Part VI, Line 15a/b — [Compensation review process for CEO and key employees]
Part VI, Line 19 — [How governing documents are made available]

Functional Expense Allocation Methodology:
  The organization allocates expenses to functional categories using the following methods:
  - Direct assignment: expenses clearly identified with a single function are assigned directly
  - Time-study allocation: shared employee costs (including ED salary) are allocated based on
    [quarterly/annual] time studies showing time devoted to each function
  - Square-footage: occupancy costs are allocated based on [X]% program / [Y]% M&G usage
  All allocations are reviewed by the Board's Finance Committee annually.
```

**Schedule O Output Shape** (in dataset_schedules.json):
```json

  "narratives": [
    {
      "reference": "Part VI, Line 11b",
      "question": "Describe the process, if any, used by the organization to review this Form 990",
      "narrative": "..."
    }
