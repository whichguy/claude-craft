  Phase 1: Context & Requirements Analysis

  Priority Focus: All 9 categories - establishing baseline priorities
  Target Confidence: 30-50%

  Requirements Discovery & Prior Decision Rehydration

  Rehydrated Context:
  - Requirements Source: docs/use-cases.md and docs/requirements.md
  - Prior Decisions Loaded: YES - docs/technology-recommendations.md exists
  - Use Cases Discovered: 42 use cases (UC001-UC042)
  - Initial NFRs Derived: 15 patterns identified

  Key Use Cases Loaded:
  - UC001: Capture Conversation Start (Hook infrastructure, <100ms)
  - UC002: Capture User Message (Zero message loss)
  - UC003: Capture Agent Response (Complete response storage)
  - UC004: Display Latest Conversation (Color-coded terminal output)
  - UC007: Extract Knowledge Patterns (NLP/text analysis)
  - UC010: Real-time Streaming Display (<200ms latency)

  Prior Technology Decisions (from technology-recommendations.md):
  - CLI Framework: Commander.js + Chalk (213M weekly downloads, 95%
  confidence)
  - Data Format: JSONL (append-only, stream-friendly, 98% confidence)
  - Storage: Native Node.js with atomic operations
  - Testing: Mocha+Chai (lightweight, 92% confidence)

  Priority Baseline Establishment

  Based on use cases and prior decisions:

  Initial Priority Assignment:
  1. Execution Environment: Priority 1 (Node.js standalone - already decided)
  2. Storage System: Priority 1 (Local files with JSONL)
  3. Storage Format: Priority 1 (JSONL for append-only)
  4. User Interface: Priority 1 (CLI with colors)
  5. Authentication: Priority 0 (No auth required initially)
  6. API Service: Priority 1 (Simple hooks for Claude Code)
  7. Testing Framework: Priority 2 (Mocha+Chai)
  8. Programming Language: Priority 1 (JavaScript/Node.js)
  9. CI/CD: Priority 0 (Manual deployment initially)

  Total Complexity Score: 9/81 (Green Zone - Minimal complexity)

  Output: Context loaded with strong prior decisions, minimal complexity
  approach validated

  ---
  Phase 2: Technical Constraints & Priority Assessment

  Priority Focus: Constraint analysis and priority validation
  Target Confidence: 50-65%

  Constraint Discovery & Priority Validation

  Platform Constraints:
  - Claude Code Hooks: Forces simple integration approach
  - Local-first: No cloud dependencies allowed
  - Terminal output: Must support ANSI colors
  - File system: Must handle atomic operations

  Resource Constraints:
  - Timeline: 5-day MVP requirement
  - Team expertise: JavaScript/Node.js confirmed
  - Maintenance: Single developer capacity

  NFR Systematic Derivation

  Building on Phase 1 NFRs:
  - Performance: <100ms hook response, <500ms display
  - Reliability: Zero message loss, atomic writes
  - Scalability: Handle 10K+ messages per session
  - Compatibility: Cross-platform (Windows/Mac/Linux)

  NFR Evolution This Phase:
  - Phase 1 NFRs: 15 basic patterns
  - Phase 2 NFRs: 8 additional detailed requirements
  - Total Coverage: 85%
  - Conflicts with Prior Architecture: None

  Output: Validated priority assignments with constraint justification and
  85% NFR coverage

  Technology Decision Cards

  technology: Commander.js
  category: UI/CLI Framework
  priority_level: 1
  confidence: 95%

  prior_decision: Commander.js (maintaining)
  change_reason: Maintaining - validated by use cases

  alternatives_considered: [oclif, yargs, minimist]
  selection_rationale: Best balance of features and simplicity
  trade_offs:
