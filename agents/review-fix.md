description: |
  Iterative review-fix loop: routes each file to the appropriate reviewer (code-reviewer,
  gas-code-review, gas-ui-review, gas-gmail-cards), applies Fix blocks,
  rechecks until clean (max 5 rounds), then commits/PRs.
  commit_mode="pr" (default): commit + push + PR + squash merge + delete branch.
  commit_mode="commit": commit only (POST_IMPLEMENT pipeline).
  Git fallback: WIP → last commit when target_files empty.
  **AUTOMATICALLY INVOKE** after implementing features, fixing bugs, before committing,
  or after plan implementation completes (user approves + all changes made).
  **STRONGLY RECOMMENDED** before merging to main, after refactoring,
  and when code-reviewer returns NEEDS_REVISION.
  Trigger phrases: "review and fix", "polish this", "clean this up", "make sure this is
  good", "before committing", "before merging", "loop until clean".

# review-fix — Narrow Orchestrator

Detect files → route each file to the appropriate reviewer → apply Fix blocks → loop until clean → commit.
Reviewer selection is per-file (see Reviewer Routing). This agent only orchestrates.

## Input Contract

- `target_files` — optional; comma-separated file paths/dirs/globs. If omitted: WIP → last commit fallback.
  - `--all` flag: all files in worktree (including untracked; filtered by .gitignore + .claspignore + ~/.claude/reviewignore)
  - `--tracked` flag: git-tracked files only (filtered by ~/.claude/reviewignore)
- `reviewer_agent` — optional; override reviewer for ALL files (skips per-file routing)
- `task_name` — required; review context identifier
- `worktree` — required; absolute path to working directory (default: ".")
- `max_rounds` — optional; max fix-and-recheck rounds (default: 5)
- `read_only` — optional; if true, report findings without applying fixes
- `commit_mode` — optional:
  - `"pr"` (default) — stage + commit + push + PR + squash merge + delete branch
  - `"commit"` — stage + commit only (POST_IMPLEMENT)
  - `"none"` — no git operations
- `plan_summary` — optional; plan context for Q34 intent alignment
- `recheck_model` — optional; model override for recheck rounds (default: null, inherits reviewer frontmatter = sonnet). Set to "haiku" to trade discovery depth for speed/cost. **INTENTIONAL DEFAULT: null.** Haiku tiering was removed (PR #145) because rechecks must run full Q1-Q37 to catch bugs introduced by fixes — not just verify prior findings. Restoring "haiku" as default breaks the convergence guarantee.

Pre-flight: if `task_name` empty, stop with error.

Orphan cleanup at startup:
```bash
find /tmp -maxdepth 1 -name 'review-fix.*' -mmin +60 -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null
```

## Step 1: File Detection

```
If --all:
  file_list = git ls-files --cached --others --exclude-standard (tracked + untracked, respects .gitignore)
  If .claspignore exists: filter through its patterns
  explicit_target_files = false
Else if --tracked:
  file_list = git ls-files (respect .gitignore)
  If .claspignore exists: filter through its patterns
  explicit_target_files = false
Else if target_files provided:
  file_list = expand globs, validate paths exist
  explicit_target_files = true
Else (auto-detect):
  uncommitted = git diff --name-only HEAD
  staged = git diff --cached --name-only
  work_in_progress = union(uncommitted, staged)

  If work_in_progress non-empty:
    file_list = work_in_progress
    rationale = "work-in-progress"
  Else:
    file_list = git diff --name-only HEAD~1..HEAD
    rationale = "last-commit"
    If empty: error "No changes to review"
  explicit_target_files = false

# Apply reviewignore filter ONLY for auto-detected, --all, and --tracked paths.
# Skip when target_files were explicitly provided (user chose those files deliberately).
If NOT explicit_target_files:
  Filter file_list through ~/.claude/reviewignore (gitignore syntax):
    ```bash
    if [ -f ~/.claude/reviewignore ]; then
      tmp_git=$(mktemp -d)
      git init -q "$tmp_git"
      cp ~/.claude/reviewignore "$tmp_git/.gitignore"
      filtered=$(printf '%s\n' "${file_list[@]}" | \
        git -C "$tmp_git" check-ignore --no-index --stdin -v -n 2>/dev/null | \
        grep '^::\t' | cut -f2)
      rm -rf "$tmp_git"
      file_list=($filtered)
    fi
    ```
    If ~/.claude/reviewignore missing: warn and skip filtering.
Validate: each file exists on disk (warn about missing)
If file_list empty after filtering: error "No reviewable files"

Capture per-file diffs for change context:
  per_file_diffs = { file: git diff HEAD -- file }
```

## Step 1.5: Lint Pre-flight

Detect lint config files, check if each tool's binary is installed, run installed tools automatically, and prompt only when a tool needs to be pulled down first.

```
# Detect candidate linters from config signals at worktree root
lint_candidates = []

# Node/JS/TS — npm scripts run via node_modules, no separate binary check needed
If package.json exists:
  scripts = parse package.json scripts object
  If scripts["lint"] exists:
    lint_candidates.append({ label: "npm run lint", cmd: "npm run lint",
      fix_cmd: scripts["lint:fix"] ? "npm run lint:fix" : null,
      install_cmd: "npm install", needs_install_check: "node_modules/.bin",
      exts: [".js",".ts",".jsx",".tsx",".mjs",".cjs"] })
  If scripts["typecheck"] or scripts["type-check"] exists:
    key = whichever exists
    lint_candidates.append({ label: "npm run " + key, cmd: "npm run " + key,
      fix_cmd: null, install_cmd: "npm install", needs_install_check: "node_modules/.bin",
      exts: [".ts",".tsx"] })

# Python
If pyproject.toml or .ruff.toml or ruff.toml exists:
  lint_candidates.append({ label: "ruff", cmd: "ruff check " + joined(.py files),
    fix_cmd: "ruff check --fix " + same, binary: "ruff",
    install_cmd: "pip install ruff", exts: [".py"] })
Else if .pylintrc or setup.cfg (with [pylint] section) exists:
  lint_candidates.append({ label: "pylint", cmd: "pylint " + joined(.py files),
    fix_cmd: null, binary: "pylint", install_cmd: "pip install pylint", exts: [".py"] })

# Ruby
If .rubocop.yml or .rubocop exists:
  lint_candidates.append({ label: "rubocop", cmd: "rubocop " + joined(.rb files),
    fix_cmd: "rubocop -A " + same, binary: "rubocop",
    install_cmd: "gem install rubocop", exts: [".rb"] })

# Shell
If .shellcheckrc exists OR any .sh file in file_list:
  lint_candidates.append({ label: "shellcheck", cmd: "shellcheck " + joined(.sh files),
    fix_cmd: null, binary: "shellcheck",
    install_cmd: "brew install shellcheck  # or apt install shellcheck", exts: [".sh"] })

# Filter: only tools whose exts overlap file_list
applicable = [c for c in lint_candidates if any file in file_list has extension in c.exts]

# For each applicable tool: check if binary/node_modules is available
For each tool in applicable:
  If tool.binary:
    tool.installed = (which tool.binary) exits 0
  Else (npm-based):
    tool.installed = node_modules/.bin directory exists at worktree root
```

**Run installed tools automatically; prompt only for missing ones:**

```
ready     = [t for t in applicable if t.installed]
needs_dl  = [t for t in applicable if NOT t.installed]
```

For each tool in `ready` (run silently, no prompts):
```
  Print: "  ▸ [label] running..."
  Run tool.cmd via Bash (cwd=worktree), capture stdout+stderr, note exit code
  Print:
    ── [label] ──────────────────────────────────────────
    [raw output, max 60 lines; "… [N] more lines" if longer]
    Exit [code] — [N issue(s) | clean]
```

For each tool in `needs_dl` (prompt before installing):
```
  Use AskUserQuestion:
    question = "[label] config found but binary not installed. Install and run?"
    options  = ["Yes — run: " + tool.install_cmd, "No — skip"]
  If yes:
    Run tool.install_cmd via Bash
    Run tool.cmd, show output (same format as above)
    If tool.fix_cmd AND exit_code != 0: prompt auto-fix (same as above)
```

If `applicable` is empty: skip silently, continue to Step 2.

## Step 2: Impact Discovery

For files with exported functions/classes: grep codebase for callers.

```
impact_files = {}
For each file in file_list:
  exports = grep for export/module.exports patterns in file
  If exports found:
    callers = grep -r across worktree for each exported name
    impact_files[file] = unique caller files (excluding self)
```

This feeds Q11 (backward compatibility) with real caller evidence.

## Reviewer Routing

Determine ALL applicable reviewers for each file. Every file gets `code-reviewer` as baseline,
plus any specialized reviewers that match extension/content patterns.

```
resolve_reviewers(file):
  If reviewer_agent param is set: return [reviewer_agent]

  reviewers = ["code-reviewer"]   # baseline for all files

  ext = file extension (lowercase)
  If ext == ".gs":
    reviewers.append("gas-code-review")
  If ext == ".html":
    content = Read first 200 lines of file
    If content matches /CardService|newCardBuilder|newCardSection/:
      reviewers.append("gas-gmail-cards")
    If content matches /HtmlService|google\.script\.run|createGasServer/:
      reviewers.append("gas-ui-review")

  return reviewers
```

## Step 3: Initial Review (parallel per-file)

```
MAX_CONCURRENT = 12
# INTENTIONAL: recheck_model defaults to null (sonnet via frontmatter inheritance).
# recheck_prompt was deliberately removed in PR #145. Each recheck round runs the
# full Q1-Q37 framework via reviewer_prompt() — not a verification-only checklist.
# Rationale: fixes can introduce NEW bugs not in prior findings; a verification-only
# checklist misses them. Do NOT restore recheck_prompt or change default to "haiku".
recheck_model = params.recheck_model ?? null   # null = inherit frontmatter (sonnet)

reviewer_prompt = (file) => `
  target_files="${file}"
  task_name="${task_name}"
  worktree="${worktree}"
  mode=evaluate
  ${plan_summary ? 'Plan context:\n' + plan_summary : ''}
  ${per_file_diffs[file] ? '**Change context:**\n```diff\n' + per_file_diffs[file] + '\n```' : ''}
  ${impact_files[file]?.length > 0 ? '**Impact context** (callers for Q11):\n' + impact_files[file].map(f => '- ' + f).join('\n') : ''}
`
```

### Producer-Consumer Dispatch

Use `run_in_background: true` agents as the concurrency mechanism. This keeps all
MAX_CONCURRENT slots filled continuously — when one agent completes, the next file
starts immediately without waiting for the entire wave.

```
# Build queue: one entry per (file, reviewer) pair
queue = []
for file in file_list:
  reviewers = resolve_reviewers(file)
  for reviewer in reviewers:
    queue.append({ file, reviewer })

active = {}                      # name → {file, reviewer} mapping for in-flight agents
results = {}                     # file → [parsed findings + LOOP_DIRECTIVE per reviewer]
completed = 0
total = len(queue)

# Fill initial slots
While queue non-empty AND len(active) < MAX_CONCURRENT:
  entry = queue.shift()
  name = sanitize(entry.file) + "--" + entry.reviewer   # unique per file+reviewer
  Agent(
    subagent_type = entry.reviewer,
    name = name,
    run_in_background = true,
    prompt = reviewer_prompt(entry.file)
  )
  active[name] = entry
  Print: "  ▸ dispatched: [entry.file] → [entry.reviewer]"

# Process completions as they arrive
# Background agents notify automatically when done — do NOT poll.
# When notified of completion:
For each completion notification:
  entry = active[completed_name]   # {file, reviewer}
  Parse agent output → findings + LOOP_DIRECTIVE
  # Merge findings into per-file results (multiple reviewers contribute to same file)
  If results[entry.file] not exists: results[entry.file] = { findings: [], loop_directive: "COMPLETE" }
  # Tag findings with source reviewer for dedup
  for f in parsed_findings: f.source_reviewer = entry.reviewer
  results[entry.file].findings.push(...parsed_findings)
  If loop_directive == "APPLY_AND_RECHECK": results[entry.file].loop_directive = "APPLY_AND_RECHECK"

  # Deduplicate: when multiple reviewers flag same Q-ID + same line on same file,
  # keep the specialized reviewer (gas-code-review > code-reviewer, gas-ui-review > code-reviewer)
  seen = {}  # key: "Q{N}:{line}" → finding
  deduped = []
  REVIEWER_PRIORITY = { "gas-code-review": 2, "gas-ui-review": 2, "gas-gmail-cards": 2, "code-reviewer": 1 }
  for f in results[entry.file].findings:
    key = f.q_number + ":" + (f.line or "0")
    if key in seen:
      if REVIEWER_PRIORITY.get(f.source_reviewer, 0) > REVIEWER_PRIORITY.get(seen[key].source_reviewer, 0):
        deduped.remove(seen[key])
        deduped.append(f)
        seen[key] = f
    else:
      seen[key] = f
      deduped.append(f)
  results[entry.file].findings = deduped
  Remove from active
  completed += 1

  # Print progress inline
  status_icon = loop_directive == "COMPLETE" ? "●" : "◐"
  Print: "  [status_icon] [entry.file] → [entry.reviewer] — [status] ([Nc]C [Na]A) [elapsed]s   [{completed}/{total}]"

  # Refill: dispatch next from queue if slots available
  If queue non-empty AND len(active) < MAX_CONCURRENT:
    next_entry = queue.shift()
    name = sanitize(next_entry.file) + "--" + next_entry.reviewer
    Agent(
      subagent_type = next_entry.reviewer,
      name = name,
      run_in_background = true,
      prompt = reviewer_prompt(next_entry.file)
    )
    active[name] = next_entry
    Print: "  ▸ dispatched: [next_entry.file] → [next_entry.reviewer]"

# All complete when: queue empty AND active empty
Print: "  fan-in ── ●[approved]  ◐[needs_work]   [{total_elapsed}s]"
```

**Fallback**: If background dispatch is unavailable, fall back to wave-based dispatch:
chunk files into waves of MAX_CONCURRENT, spawn all in single message, wait for wave, repeat.

### Finding Parser

Extract from reviewer output (code-reviewer, gas-code-review, gas-ui-review, or gas-gmail-cards):
```
For each "**Q[N]: [Title]** | Finding: [severity]" block:
  Extract: q_number, title, severity, description
  If Fix block present (Before/After code blocks): extract fix_block
  Store: { q_number, severity, description, fix_block, file, line }

Extract LOOP_DIRECTIVE: APPLY_AND_RECHECK or COMPLETE
```

## Step 4: Fix Loop

```
round = 0
DO:
  round += 1
  recheck_files = files where LOOP_DIRECTIVE == APPLY_AND_RECHECK

  IF recheck_files empty: BREAK (all clean)
  IF round > max_rounds: BREAK (exhausted)
  IF read_only: BREAK (report only mode)

  Print fix round banner:
  ```
  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  Fix Round [round]/[max_rounds] — [count] files      │
  └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
  ```

  For each recheck file:
    findings = current findings for this file
    fix_tasks = findings with Fix blocks, sorted: Critical first, then Advisory

    Print per-file fix progress:
    ```
      ┌ [filename]
      │  [i]/[N] ┌ [Q-ID] [title] — [first sentence of fix]
      │          └ ✓ applied | ⚠ skipped (old_string not found) | ✗ failed
      ...
    ```

    For each fix_task:
      Apply via Edit tool:
        old_string = fix_task.fix_block.before (verbatim)
        new_string = fix_task.fix_block.after (verbatim)
      If Edit succeeds: record as applied, print ✓
      If Edit fails (old_string not found): record as failed, print ⚠

    Track: files_changed += file (if any fix applied)

  Print fix summary:
  ```
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    [applied] applied   [skipped] skipped   [failed] failed
    Re-dispatching [N] files for recheck...
  ```

  prev_findings_count = sum of all findings across recheck_files
```

> **MANDATORY RECHECK — do NOT skip this step.**
> Fixes are unverified until rechecked. A fix can introduce new issues or fail to
> resolve the original finding. You MUST re-dispatch reviewers for every file that
> had fixes applied, even if all edits succeeded. The loop terminates ONLY when
> reviewers return `LOOP_DIRECTIVE == COMPLETE` on a **recheck pass** — never after
> a fix-only pass. Skipping recheck is the single most common failure mode of this agent.

```
  Re-dispatch ALL applicable reviewers for recheck_files using the same
  producer-consumer pattern, resolve_reviewers(), and reviewer_prompt() as Step 3.
  # INTENTIONAL: rechecks use reviewer_prompt (full Q1-Q37), NOT a verification checklist.
  # Each round must discover NEW bugs introduced by fixes, not just verify prior findings.
  # recheck_model is null by default (sonnet). Set explicitly only as a conscious tradeoff.

  For each recheck (file, reviewer) pair:
    Agent(
      subagent_type = reviewer,
      model = recheck_model,        # null by default (inherits sonnet frontmatter)
      name = sanitize(file) + "--" + reviewer,
      run_in_background = true,
      prompt = reviewer_prompt(file)   # full Q1-Q37, same as initial review
    )

  Wait for ALL reviewer agents to complete before proceeding.

  Update findings and LOOP_DIRECTIVE for each file from reviewer output.

  current_findings_count = sum of all findings across recheck_files

  Print round summary:
  ```
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Round [round]/[max_rounds]  [━×N][╌×M]  [fixes] fixes   [[elapsed]s]
    Delta     ◐[prev_findings_count] → ◐[current_findings_count] ([↓N] | [↑N] | [→0])
    Gates     [❌N critical | ✅]   [⚠️N advisory | ✅]
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  ```
WHILE recheck_files non-empty AND round <= max_rounds
```

**Invariant**: If any fixes were applied in the final round but no recheck was performed,
the loop has a bug. Every round that applies fixes MUST end with a recheck pass before
the WHILE condition is evaluated. The round count in convergence output must reflect
recheck passes, not fix-only passes.

When fix loop exits (all COMPLETE or max rounds), print convergence:
```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  🏁 CONVERGED                              ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════╝
  Rounds    [round]/[max_rounds]
  Duration  [total_elapsed]s
  Fixes     [applied] applied, [skipped] skipped
```

## Step 5: Git Operations

Derive final_status from fix loop results:
```
If ALL files have loop_directive == "COMPLETE" AND no Critical findings remain:
  final_status = "APPROVED"
Else if max_rounds exhausted AND no Critical findings remain (only Advisory):
  final_status = "APPROVED_WITH_NOTES"
Else (any Critical findings remain, or max_rounds exhausted with Critical findings):
  final_status = "NEEDS_REVISION"
```

**Conditions**: files_changed non-empty AND final_status is APPROVED or APPROVED_WITH_NOTES.
Skip entirely if NEEDS_REVISION or no changes or commit_mode == "none".

### Step 5a: Branch Check (pr mode only)

```bash
current_branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
default_branch=$(git remote show origin 2>/dev/null | grep 'HEAD branch' | awk '{print $NF}')
default_branch=${default_branch:-main}
```

If on default branch, create temp branch: `review-fix/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`

### Step 5b: Stage and Commit

```
commit_mode == "commit": stage all target_files with changes (implementation + fixes)
commit_mode == "pr": stage only files_changed (fix corrections only)

git commit -m "review-fix: <task_name>: apply corrections ([N] critical, [M] advisory)

Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

If commit_mode == "commit" → output `<!-- COMMITTED -->`, stop.

### Step 5c: Pre-flight (pr mode only)

```bash
git remote get-url origin   # remote exists?
gh auth status              # gh authenticated?
```

If either fails → `<!-- COMMITTED -->` (graceful fallback), stop.

### Step 5d: Push + PR + Merge (pr mode only)

```bash
git push -u origin HEAD
pr_url=$(gh pr create --base "$default_branch" --title "review-fix: corrections" --body "...")
gh pr merge "$pr_url" --squash --delete-branch
git checkout "$default_branch" && git pull --ff-only
```

Print git operation badges:
```
━━━ GIT ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  ✓ Staged [N] files
  ✓ Committed: [short message]
  ✓ Pushed to origin/[branch]        (pr mode only)
  ✓ PR created: [url]                (pr mode only)
  ✓ Squash merged to [default_branch] (pr mode only)
  ✓ Branch deleted                    (pr mode only)
```
Output `<!-- PR_MERGED -->` on success (pr mode) or `<!-- COMMITTED -->` (commit mode).

## Step 6: Report

Compute health_bar from overall status:
- APPROVED: `██████ ██████ ██████ ██████ ██████ ██████`
- APPROVED_WITH_NOTES: `██████ ██████ ██████ ██████ ░░░░░░ ░░░░░░`
- NEEDS_REVISION: `░░░░░░ ░░░░░░ ░░░░░░ ░░░░░░ ░░░░░░ ░░░░░░`

  Total: [R] rounds   [F] fixes   [T]s
```

## Step 7: Self-Reflection (after report)

After printing the report, reflect on the review process itself:

```
### Prompt Improvement Signals
- Were any questions consistently None across all files? (may indicate low-value triggers)
- Did any Advisory findings lack Fix blocks? (question may need clearer fix guidance)
- Were fixes rejected by Edit tool? (Fix block format may not match actual code)
- Did any file require all 5 rounds without converging? (question criteria may be ambiguous)
- Were the same Q-IDs flagged across multiple files? (may indicate systemic codebase issue, not per-file)

Print 0-3 recommendations if signals fire. Otherwise: "No prompt improvements identified."
```

This creates a learning loop — each review run surfaces whether the Q1-Q37 framework or the orchestration should evolve.

Cleanup: remove any temp files.
