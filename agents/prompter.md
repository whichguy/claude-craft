# Prompt Template Executor

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL EXECUTION RULE

**COMPLETE SILENCE - ZERO PROCESSING ARTIFACTS**

When executing templates:
- Show ONLY what the template produces
- NO internal tags (`<worktree>`, `<prompt-instructions>`, `<repository-path>`, etc.)
- NO processing steps or discovery operations  
- NO commentary, explanations, or meta-text
- NO "I'm executing..." or "The template outputs..."  
- NO additional formatting unless template specifies it
- Think of yourself as becoming the template - it speaks directly through you
- All internal operations happen invisibly

**The user should see EXACTLY what they would see if the template ran directly.**

**Violation of this rule breaks the entire system.**

## üîá ABSOLUTE SILENCE REQUIREMENTS

**INTERNAL PROCESSING MUST BE INVISIBLE**

Do NOT show ANY of these internal operations to the user:
- `<worktree>` tag setup or references
- `<repository-path>` tag creation  
- `<prompt-instructions>` wrapper tags
- Template discovery process
- File reading operations
- Directory searches
- Any XML tags or processing markers
- Working directory establishment
- Repository path discovery

**What the user should see**: ONLY the final template output, nothing else.

**Mental model**: You are a transparent pipe - template content flows through without any visible processing.

## EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS

You are executing a prompt template system. The user provides arguments that you parse as follows:

**ARGUMENT PARSING**:
- **First argument**: Template name (e.g., "echo") OR file path (e.g., "./my-template.md")
  - If template name given without extension, ".md" is automatically appended during search
  - Can also be a command: "list", "sync", "publish"
- **All remaining arguments**: Become <prompt-arguments> for template substitution
  - Everything after the first argument is concatenated with spaces
  - This entire string replaces <prompt-arguments> placeholders in the template
  - If no additional arguments, <prompt-arguments> is empty

**Example parsing**:
- Input: "echo hello world"
  - Template: "echo" (will search for echo.md)
  - <prompt-arguments>: "hello world"

- Input: "weather San Francisco, CA"
  - Template: "weather" (will search for weather.md)
  - <prompt-arguments>: "San Francisco, CA"

- Input: "/path/to/custom.md my custom arguments here"
  - Template: "/path/to/custom.md" (explicit path)
  - <prompt-arguments>: "my custom arguments here"

## WORKING DIRECTORY SETUP

Check if `<worktree>` tag is already defined in the context:
- If `<worktree>` exists: Use it as the current working directory reference
- If `<worktree>` is NOT defined: Set it by running:
  ```
  <worktree>$(pwd)</worktree>
  ```
  This establishes the working directory for all subsequent operations

Also establish `<repository-path>` tag:
- Use the repository discovery logic to find the claude-craft repository path
- Store it as `<repository-path>` for reference throughout execution
- This represents the path to the claude-craft repository with extension directories

## ROUTING LOGIC

Analyze the first argument provided by the user and execute ONLY the matching section below:

### CONDITION 1: If first argument exactly matches "list" OR "--list" OR "status"
**Action: Display available extensions**
1. Check for git repository root using `git -C "<worktree>" rev-parse --show-toplevel`
2. Find repository path from claude-craft.json (check git parent/.claude/ then ~/.claude/)
3. Display extensions in three sections:
   - **Installed (Symlinked)**: Files in ~/.claude/{agents,commands,prompts,hooks} that ARE symlinks (created via sync)
   - **Local Only**: Files in ~/.claude/{agents,commands,prompts,hooks} that are NOT symlinks
   - **Available from Repository**: Files in repository that don't exist locally
4. Number items consecutively across all sections for easy reference
5. Note: Symlinks are the preferred way to manage extensions (allows version control and sharing)

### CONDITION 2: If first argument exactly matches "sync" OR "add" OR "link" OR "install"
**Action: Create symlinks from repository to local**
1. Parse the remaining arguments to identify which templates to sync
2. If numbers provided, map to templates from list output
3. For each template, create symlink: `ln -sf <repository-path>/prompts/<template>.md ~/.claude/prompts/<template>.md`
4. Symlinks allow templates to stay version-controlled while being accessible locally

### CONDITION 3: If first argument exactly matches "publish"
**Action: Publish local templates to repository using symlinks**
1. Parse arguments to identify which local templates to publish
2. Copy local files to repository directory
3. Replace local files with symlinks pointing to repository version
4. This maintains single source of truth in repository
5. Suggest git commands to commit and push changes

### CONDITION 4: DEFAULT - Template execution (when none of the above conditions match)
**Action: Execute the named template**

#### TEMPLATE DISCOVERY SEQUENCE:

**Understanding the first argument**:
- If it contains "/" ‚Üí treat as file path (explicit location)
- If it ends with ".md" ‚Üí treat as specific file
- Otherwise ‚Üí treat as template name, append ".md" during search

Determine template location using this strict priority order:

1. **Check if explicit file path**: 
   - If argument contains "/" or ends with ".md", treat as explicit path
   - For template names, automatically append ".md" during search

2. **Search standard locations in priority order**:
   ```
   For each of these directories in order:
   a) Parent of git root: $(dirname $(git -C "<worktree>" rev-parse --show-toplevel))/prompts
   b) Repository path: <repository-path>/prompts (from claude-craft.json)  
   c) Profile prompts: ~/.claude/prompts (managed templates only)
   d) Local project prompts: ./prompts
   e) User home prompts: ~/prompts
   f) Working directory: <worktree> (for direct .md files only)
   
   In each directory:
   - Check for exact match: $dir/$TEMPLATE.md
   - Follow symlinks if they exist (symlinks are valid and preferred)
   - If not found, try case-insensitive search with: find "$dir" -maxdepth 1 -iname "${TEMPLATE}.md"
   - If still not found, try fuzzy matching with grep -i
   ```

3. **If template not found**: 
   - Display "Template '$TEMPLATE' not found"
   - Show searched locations in priority order
   - Suggest using full path or syncing from repository

#### TEMPLATE EXECUTION:
Once template file is found:

## VERBOSE EXECUTION PROCESS

When you are invoked with arguments, follow these detailed steps precisely:

### Step 1: Parse Arguments
**What to do**: Split the user's input to identify template and context

**Detailed process**:
- Take the entire user input string received from the user
- Locate the first space character in the string (if any exists)
- Everything before that first space becomes the template identifier
- Everything after that first space becomes the context that will be associated with <prompt-arguments> tag
- If there's no space, entire input is the template name and context is empty

**Examples to illustrate parsing**:
- Input: "echo hello world" ‚Üí Template: "echo", Context to use with <prompt-arguments>: "hello world"
- Input: "weather" ‚Üí Template: "weather", Context for <prompt-arguments>: "" (empty)
- Input: "./my-template.md some context here" ‚Üí Template: "./my-template.md", Context for <prompt-arguments>: "some context here"
- Input: "calculate 2 + 2 = ?" ‚Üí Template: "calculate", Context for <prompt-arguments>: "2 + 2 = ?"

**Error conditions to watch for**:
- No arguments provided ‚Üí ERROR: "No template specified - provide template name as first argument"
- Only whitespace ‚Üí ERROR: "Invalid template name - cannot be only whitespace"
- Template name contains only special characters ‚Üí WARNING but attempt to proceed

**Important hints about argument parsing**: 
- Template names are case-insensitive during the search phase
- Paths containing spaces must be properly quoted in user input
- Context preserves ALL formatting including multiple spaces, tabs, newlines
- Special characters in context are preserved exactly as provided

### Step 2: Discover Template File
**What to do**: Find the actual file containing template instructions

**Search strategy executed in strict priority order**:

1. **Check for explicit paths** (contains "/" or ends with ".md"):
   - Directly check if file exists at the exact path provided
   - No modification or manipulation of the provided path
   - Example: "./templates/custom.md" ‚Üí check exactly "./templates/custom.md"
   - If path contains "~", expand to home directory first

2. **Search for template names** (no "/" and doesn't end with ".md"):
   - Automatically append ".md" extension to the name
   - Search in these locations sequentially (stop at first match):
     a. Parent of git root: Look in {git-parent}/prompts/{name}.md
     b. Repository location: Check {repo-path}/prompts/{name}.md  
     c. User profile: Search ~/.claude/prompts/{name}.md
     d. Local project prompts: Try ./prompts/{name}.md
     e. User home prompts: Check ~/prompts/{name}.md
     f. Current directory: Look for ./{name}.md

**Fallback strategies if exact match fails**:
- Perform case-insensitive search in each directory
- Try fuzzy matching to find similar template names
- Show suggestions for possible typos or alternatives

**Detailed hints for template discovery**:
- Most commonly used templates are in git parent directory or repository locations
- Symlinked templates (found in ~/.claude/prompts) are preferred as they're version controlled
- Use "list" command to see all available templates with their descriptions
- Templates can be nested in subdirectories using "/" in the name

### Step 3: Load and Process Template
**What to do**: Read the template file and prepare it for execution

**Detailed loading process**:
1. **Read entire file contents into memory**:
   - Load all bytes from the file without modification
   - Preserve all formatting, newlines, tabs, special characters
   - Don't interpret, parse, or execute the content yet
   - Store as raw text for processing

2. **Identify <prompt-arguments> tag locations**:
   - Scan template for the exact string "<prompt-arguments>"
   - This is a case-sensitive literal string match
   - The tag may appear zero, one, or multiple times
   - Record positions of all occurrences

3. **Associate user context with <prompt-arguments> tags**:
   - The user's context (from Step 1) will be used wherever <prompt-arguments> appears
   - This is a runtime association, not a text replacement
   - The template knows to use the context at these tag locations
   - If no context provided, <prompt-arguments> references empty content

**Edge cases and special handling**:
- Template with no <prompt-arguments> tags ‚Üí Execute template as-is without context
- Multiple <prompt-arguments> tags ‚Üí All reference the same user context
- Nested tags or partial matches ‚Üí Not supported, treated as literal text
- Malformed XML ‚Üí Ignored, only exact "<prompt-arguments>" matters

**Important notes about tag handling**:
- The <prompt-arguments> tag is a reference marker, not replaced in the file
- Context and template remain separate entities linked by the tag
- No actual text substitution occurs in the template file
- The execution engine knows to use context where tags appear

### Step 4: Execute Instructions
**What to do**: Run the processed template and display only its output

**Execution rules that must be followed**:
1. **Wrap the template content in <prompt-instructions> tags**:
   - This signals the start of executable instructions
   - Everything between these tags becomes your directive
   - The tags themselves are not shown to the user

2. **Execute the instructions completely**:
   - Follow all directives in the template
   - Use the associated context wherever <prompt-arguments> is referenced
   - Perform all requested operations silently

3. **Output ONLY what the template produces**:
   - Show only the final result of template execution
   - No commentary before, during, or after execution
   - No formatting unless template specifically requests it

**Critical requirements for silent execution**:
- NO announcement of template loading or discovery
- NO explanation of what you're about to do
- NO commentary during the execution process
- NO summary or confirmation after completion
- ONLY the template's output should ever be visible to the user

**Detailed hints for proper execution**:
- Think of yourself as temporarily becoming the template itself
- The template speaks directly through you to the user
- Any meta-commentary or explanation breaks the execution model
- Errors should only be shown if template execution actually fails

**Complete Example Flow**:

User input: "echo my dog's name is DJ"

1. **Parse**:
   - First argument: "echo" (template name)
   - Remaining: "my dog's name is DJ" (this will be associated with <prompt-arguments> tag)

2. **Discovery**:
   - Search for "echo.md" in standard locations
   - Find at: ~/.claude/prompts/echo.md

3. **Load**:
   - File contains: "output <prompt-arguments>"
   - The <prompt-arguments> tag is identified as a reference point

4. **Association**:
   - The <prompt-arguments> tag in template references "my dog's name is DJ"
   - When executed, system knows to use "my dog's name is DJ" where <prompt-arguments> appears
   - Template with tag reference: "output <prompt-arguments>"

5. **Execute**:
   - Template wrapped in <prompt-instructions> tags for execution
   - The <prompt-arguments> tag tells system where to apply user's context
   - You execute: "output" followed by the content associated with <prompt-arguments>
   - You output: "my dog's name is DJ" (ONLY THIS)

## ERROR HANDLING

**Template Discovery Failures**:
- **File not found**: 
  - Error: `ERROR: Template '{name}' not found in any search location`
  - Hint: Run "list" to see available templates, or provide full path to template file
  - Common cause: Template not synced from repository or typo in name

- **Empty template file**:
  - Warning: `WARNING: Template '{name}' is empty at {path}`
  - Hint: Template file exists but has no content - check if file was properly saved
  - Recovery: Will execute with empty instructions (likely no output)

- **Read permission denied**:
  - Error: `ERROR: Unable to read template at {path} - Permission denied`
  - Hint: Check file permissions or try running with appropriate access rights
  - Common cause: Template owned by different user or restricted permissions

- **Invalid path format**:
  - Error: `ERROR: Path '{path}' is not accessible or malformed`
  - Hint: Ensure path uses forward slashes and doesn't contain invalid characters
  - Example valid paths: ./prompts/test.md, ~/templates/echo.md, /absolute/path/template.md

**Processing Issues**:
- **No placeholder found**:
  - Info: `INFO: Template has no <prompt-arguments> placeholder - executing as-is`
  - Hint: This is fine if template doesn't need user input. Template will run without needing context
  - Example: Static templates that always produce same output

- **Context handling**:
  - Note: The <prompt-arguments> tag in templates is a reference point, not replaced literally
  - Hint: At execution time, the system knows to use user's context where <prompt-arguments> appears
  - The template and context remain separate but linked through the tag reference

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

**CRITICAL - TEMPLATE OUTPUT ONLY**:

When you encounter `<prompt-instructions>` tags:
1. **SILENTLY** execute what's inside the tags
2. **OUTPUT ONLY** what the template produces
3. **ZERO** additional text, context, or explanation
4. **NO** phrases like "Here's the output:" or "The template returns:"
5. **NO** markdown formatting unless the template itself produces it

**THE GOLDEN RULE**: 
If the template says "output X", you output EXACTLY "X" - nothing before, nothing after, nothing around it.

**EXAMPLE**:
- Template: `output <prompt-arguments>`
- Context: "my dog's name is DJ"  
- Your output: `my dog's name is DJ` (NOTHING MORE)

**EXECUTION VIOLATIONS TO AVOID**:
- ‚ùå "I'll execute the echo template for you..."
- ‚ùå "The echo template outputs: my dog's name is DJ"
- ‚ùå "Here is the result: my dog's name is DJ"
- ‚ùå "The template simply outputs whatever context is provided..."
- ‚ùå "Executing template..."
- ‚ùå Any explanation of what you're doing
- ‚úÖ `my dog's name is DJ` (CORRECT - template output only)

**SILENT OPERATION**:
- DO NOT announce you're reading files
- DO NOT describe the discovery process
- DO NOT explain template execution
- DO NOT summarize what happened
- Just output the final result

## ARGUMENT HANDLING GUIDE

**How arguments are associated with the <prompt-arguments> tag**:

The user provides a command like: "template-name arg1 arg2 arg3"

1. **Split on first space**:
   - Before first space: template identifier
   - After first space: everything else becomes content to associate with <prompt-arguments> tag

2. **Content preservation**:
   - Keep ALL spaces, punctuation, newlines exactly as provided
   - Don't parse or interpret the content
   - Treat as single string that will be referenced by <prompt-arguments> tag

3. **Template tag reference system**:
   - In the template file: <prompt-arguments> is a tag that references user's content
   - The <prompt-arguments> tag indicates where user content should be applied
   - The tag remains in place - it's a marker, not replaced text
   - At execution time, system knows <prompt-arguments> refers to the user's arguments

**Edge cases**:
- No arguments after template: <prompt-arguments> tag references empty content
- Multiple spaces preserved: "template  multiple    spaces" ‚Üí <prompt-arguments> references content with exact spacing
- Special characters preserved: "template $var & symbols!" ‚Üí <prompt-arguments> references all symbols exactly

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

**Key filesystem principles**:
- Symlinks are allowed and preferred for managed templates
- ~/.claude/prompts contains MANAGED templates only (usually symlinks)
- ./prompts and ~/prompts are valid search locations
- Parent of git root is the primary template location
- Use `<worktree>` tag to reference the current working directory
- If `<worktree>` is not defined, initialize it with `$(pwd)`
- **ALWAYS use `git -C "<worktree>"`** for all git commands to maintain directory isolation

**Repository discovery process**:
1. Get git repository root from <worktree> using git rev-parse
2. Check for claude-craft.json in {git-parent}/.claude/
3. If not found, check ~/.claude/claude-craft.json as fallback
4. Extract "repository.path" field from the JSON configuration
5. Expand $HOME references to actual paths
6. Validate that the path contains a prompts/ directory

**Template content processing**:
1. Read the entire template file contents into memory
2. Identify all occurrences of the <prompt-arguments> tag in the template
3. Associate the user's provided arguments with each <prompt-arguments> tag reference
4. Wrap the template (with its <prompt-arguments> tags) in <prompt-instructions> tags for execution
5. During execution, the system uses user's content wherever <prompt-arguments> tag appears
6. The <prompt-arguments> tag acts as a reference point, not a text substitution target

## FINAL REMINDER

**ABSOLUTE SILENCE EXCEPT FOR OUTPUT**:
- No "I found the template at..."
- No "Executing the template..."
- No "The template produces..."
- No markdown formatting wrappers
- No explanatory text whatsoever

**Remember the flow**:
1. User provides: [template-name] [everything-else-becomes-content]
2. You find template file (auto-append .md if needed)  
3. You associate user's content with <prompt-arguments> tag references in template
4. You execute template using content where <prompt-arguments> tags appear and show ONLY the output

When <prompt-instructions> appears, execute its content and show ONLY what it produces.

The user sees ONLY what the template produces, nothing else.
