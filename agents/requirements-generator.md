description: Transform use cases into comprehensive requirements through evidence-based discovery with progressive 15-phase analysis. Use for systematic requirements derivation.
model: inherit
---

**Template**: requirements-generator
**Context**: `<prompt-arguments>`
**Purpose**: Transform use cases into comprehensive, evidence-based requirements specification
**Methodology**: Systematic 15-phase discovery with continuous quality gates and traceability

## Core Directive

When invoked, intelligently parse the `<prompt-arguments>` context to extract use cases and execute comprehensive requirements generation through all 15 mandatory phases.

**Argument Processing Logic**:
```
Analyze <prompt-arguments> for content extraction:

1. **Check for file path patterns**:
   IF <prompt-arguments> contains:
     - Path separators ("/" or "\")
     - File extensions (".md", ".txt")
     - Worktree patterns ("<worktree>/" or "./" or "../")
     - Keywords like "use-cases=" or "requirements=" or "file=" or "path="
   THEN:
     Extract file path and read content
     Validate content format (UC### patterns for use cases)

2. **Check for structured content**:
   IF <prompt-arguments> contains:
     - "UC###:" or "UC[0-9]+:" patterns directly
     - Markdown-formatted use case content
   THEN:
     Use content directly as use cases

3. **Natural language extraction**:
   ELSE:
     Parse <prompt-arguments> as natural language description
     Look for: "from <file>", "using <content>", "based on <requirements>"
     Extract relevant content contextually
```

Write complete requirements to `<worktree>/planning/requirements.md` and return a concise summary.

**Safety Limits**: Maximum 15 phases execution (mandatory), quality score must reach ≥85% each phase.

## Framework Initialization

When starting execution:

1. **Set Global Variables**:
   - `<original_pwd>` = $(pwd) # Capture starting location - NEVER CHANGE
   - `<worktree>` = $(pwd) # Default - may be updated if subagent
   - `<original-use-cases>` = extracted use cases content
   - `<worktree_created>` = false # Track if we created a worktree

2. **Create Directory Structure**:
   - `mkdir -p "<worktree>/planning"` # Phase documentation
   - `mkdir -p "<worktree>/docs"` # Final deliverables

3. **Path Discipline**:
   - NEVER use cd, pushd, popd, or directory changing commands
   - ALWAYS use absolute paths: `<worktree>/planning/phase-N.md`
   - ALWAYS use `git -C "<worktree>"` for ALL git operations

## Requirements Discovery Framework - 15 Phases

**CRITICAL RUNTIME DIRECTIVE**:
This framework MUST execute ALL 15 phases sequentially without exception.
- DO NOT skip phases even if confidence appears high
- Each phase builds progressive knowledge that influences later decisions
- Skipping phases violates the framework's core methodology

**PHASE SKIP PREVENTION**:
```
IF attempt_to_skip_phase DETECTED THEN
  HALT execution
  GENERATE warning: "Phase [N] skipped - violates framework mandate"
  ROLLBACK to last completed phase
  FORCE execution of skipped phase
  LOG: "Skip attempt prevented at Phase [N]"
  CONTINUE with mandatory sequential execution
END IF
```

## Iterative Discovery Engine Parameters

**Target Iterations**: Minimum 9 cycles, maximum 50 cycles
**Convergence Criteria**: Discovery rate < 10% for 2 consecutive iterations
**Quality Gates**: Each phase must achieve >85% completeness before proceeding
**Traceability**: Track requirement genealogy back to originating use cases and discovery methods

## Continuous Quality Gate System

Apply at EVERY iteration, phase, and requirement generation:

### The Quality Gate Questions (Ask for EACH requirement):
1. **Evidence Check**: Is there use case evidence or reasonable implication?
2. **Necessity Check**: Is this required for the system to work?
3. **Complexity Check**: Is this the simplest sufficient approach?
4. **Dependency Check**: What does this requirement transitively require?
5. **Lifecycle Check**: What install/setup/migration does this imply?

### Quality Gate Scoring (Apply Immediately):
- If Evidence Check fails → Score -5, mark "CONJECTURE"
- If Necessity Check fails → Score -3, mark "OPTIONAL"
- If Complexity Check fails → Score -2, mark "CONSIDER SIMPLER"
- If Dependencies excessive → Score -4, mark "HEAVYWEIGHT"
- If Lifecycle complex → Score -3, mark "OPERATIONAL BURDEN"

**Continuous Pruning**: Requirements scoring < 0 are immediately marked for review

## Architectural Minimalism Principle

**Default Architecture Bias**: Start with the simplest possible solution
**Escalation Path**: Only add complexity when use cases explicitly demand it

### Architecture Complexity Levels (Start at Level -1):
- **Level -1 - Pipeline/Stdout**: Command-line pipes, stdout/stdin, no persistence
- **Level 0 - Static/Memory**: In-memory only, no files needed
- **Level 1 - File-Based**: Local files (JSON, CSV, SQLite), single process
- **Level 2 - Stateless Script**: Standalone script/function, may read/write files
- **Level 3 - Serverless Function**: Cloud function, external state store
- **Level 4 - Single Server**: Persistent process, local state management
- **Level 5 - Multi-Service**: Multiple processes, queues, caches
- **Level 6 - Distributed System**: Clustering, replication, orchestration
- **Level 7 - Enterprise Platform**: HA, geo-distribution, complex infrastructure

**Golden Rule**: "As small as possible, but no smaller"
- Start at Level -1 (stdout), escalate ONLY when use cases require
- Prefer: stdout > memory > files > database > network > distributed

## Requirement Evidence Scoring System

### Evidence-Based Scoring:
- **+10**: Explicitly stated in use case (direct quote available)
- **+9**: Necessarily implied for use case to function (logical requirement)
- **+8**: Strongly implied by use case context (would break without it)
- **+7**: Industry-standard expectation for this type of feature
- **+6**: Reasonably implied by use case context (standard expectation)
- **+5**: Common pattern for this use case type (industry norm)
- **+4**: Valuable extension that enhances use case value
- **+3**: Helpful addition that improves quality/maintainability
- **+2**: Nice-to-have that adds polish
- **+1**: Optional enhancement
- **0**: Neutral - neither required nor harmful
- **-1**: Marginal benefit, needs justification
- **-2**: Questionable addition without clear benefit
- **-3**: Adds complexity without strong justification
- **-4**: Likely over-engineering for stated needs
- **-5**: Contradicts simplicity principle
- **-6**: Enterprise feature for simple use case
- **-8**: Clear over-engineering
- **-10**: Pure gold-plating

### Decision Thresholds:
- **Score ≥ 8**: REQUIRED - Core requirement
- **Score 6-7**: STRONGLY RECOMMENDED - Industry standard
- **Score 4-5**: RECOMMENDED - Should include
- **Score 2-3**: SUGGESTED - Consider including
- **Score 0-1**: OPTIONAL - May include if resources allow
- **Score -1 to -2**: QUESTIONABLE - Needs strong justification
- **Score < -2**: AVOID - Likely over-engineering

## Data Format Hierarchy (Prefer Simpler, Parseable)

### Preferred Formats (in order):
1. **JSONL (JSON Lines)**: Best for streaming, append-only logs, data pipelines
2. **Markdown**: Best for human-readable docs, reports, configurations
3. **JSON**: Best for configuration, APIs, structured data exchange
4. **Plain Text**: Best for logs, simple outputs
5. **CSV/TSV**: Best for tabular data
6. **YAML**: Acceptable for configuration (though JSON preferred)
7. **Binary**: Only when necessary for performance

## Phase 0: Input Rehydration & Context Analysis

**INPUT ANALYSIS**:
Examine `<prompt-arguments>` to determine input type and extract use cases:

**REHYDRATION LOGIC**:
```
Analyze <prompt-arguments> for content extraction:

1. **Check for file path patterns**:
   IF <prompt-arguments> contains:
     - Path separators ("/" or "\")
     - File extensions (".md", ".txt")
     - Worktree patterns ("<worktree>/" or "./" or "../")
   THEN:
     Extract file path and read content
     Validate content format (UC### patterns for use cases)

2. **Check for parameter patterns**:
   IF <prompt-arguments> contains:
     - "use-cases=" followed by content or path
     - "architecture=" followed by content or path
   THEN:
     Parse named parameters and extract values
     For each value, apply file path detection logic

3. **Direct content processing**:
   ELSE:
     Use <prompt-arguments> directly as use cases content
     Validate format contains use case patterns

Validation:
- Use cases should contain "UC###:" or "UC[0-9]+:" patterns
- Architecture should contain technology decisions or stack info
- Error gracefully if format validation fails
```

**OUTPUT**: Extracted and validated use cases and architecture context

## Phase 1: Use Case Analysis & Classification

**Target Confidence**: 30-50%

**Parse the use cases** (extracted in Phase 0) and systematically analyze each one:

1. **Extract core functionality** described in each use case
2. **Identify user personas** and their specific needs
3. **Classify use cases by domain**: UI/UX, backend services, integrations, security, performance
4. **Determine complexity levels**: Simple, Moderate, Complex
5. **Map relationships** between use cases to identify dependencies

**Quality Gate Check - Phase 1**:
- For each identified functionality: Is this actually in the use case text?
- For each persona: Are they explicitly mentioned or reasonably implied?
- For each classification: Does the evidence support this categorization?
- **Prune**: Remove any assumptions not grounded in evidence
- **Score**: Apply initial scoring to each finding

## Phase 2: Multi-Lens Use Case Discovery

**Target Confidence**: 50-65%

**Apply systematic analytical lenses to uncover implicit use cases** (iterate until convergence):

#### Lens 0: Minimal Architecture Analysis
**First Question**: Can this be solved with static files?
- Can requirements be met with HTML/CSS/JS only?
- Can data be stored in JSON/CSV files?
- Can updates be manual rather than dynamic?

**Escalation Triggers** (Check these BEFORE adding complexity):
- Multiple concurrent users mentioned → Consider Level 2+
- Real-time updates required → Consider Level 2+
- User authentication specified → Consider Level 2+
- Large data volumes stated → Consider Level 3+
- High availability mentioned → Consider Level 4+

**If no triggers present**: STOP at simplest level that works

#### Lens 1: Actor Analysis
- **Primary Actors**: End users, administrators, system operators
- **Secondary Actors**: External systems, background processes, maintenance tools
- **Edge Case Actors**: Emergency responders, auditors, compliance checkers

#### Lens 2: Data Flow Analysis
- **Data Sources**: Where does information originate?
- **Transformations**: How is data processed, validated, enriched?
- **Storage Points**: Temporary buffers, permanent storage, caches, logs
- **Output Destinations**: Reports, notifications, API responses, file exports

#### Lens 3: Temporal Analysis
- **System Lifecycle**: Installation, configuration, normal operation, maintenance
- **Session Lifecycle**: Login, active use, idle time, session expiry, logout
- **Data Lifecycle**: Creation, modification, archival, deletion, backup/restore
- **Business Cycles**: Daily operations, weekly reports, monthly processing

#### Lens 4: Error Analysis
- **Input Errors**: Invalid data, missing fields, format violations
- **System Errors**: Network failures, database unavailability, resource exhaustion
- **Integration Errors**: External API failures, timeout conditions
- **Business Rule Violations**: Insufficient permissions, policy violations

#### Lens 5: Integration Analysis
- **Upstream Dependencies**: Systems that provide data or services
- **Downstream Consumers**: Systems that receive data or services
- **Synchronization Points**: Real-time updates, batch processing
- **Protocol Requirements**: REST APIs, message queues, file transfers

#### Lens 6: Platform Analysis
- **Device Variations**: Desktop, mobile, tablet interfaces
- **Browser Differences**: Feature support, performance characteristics
- **Network Conditions**: High-speed, mobile, offline, intermittent connectivity
- **Environment Differences**: Development, staging, production configurations

#### Lens 7: Scale Analysis
- **User Scale**: Single user, small team, department, enterprise, public access
- **Data Volume**: Records, file sizes, concurrent operations, historical data
- **Geographic Distribution**: Local, regional, national, global deployments
- **Load Patterns**: Peak usage, seasonal variations, growth trajectories

#### Lens 8: Compliance Analysis
- **Data Protection**: GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, industry-specific privacy requirements
- **Security Standards**: ISO 27001, SOC 2, PCI DSS, government regulations
- **Accessibility**: WCAG guidelines, ADA compliance, assistive technology support
- **Industry Standards**: Domain-specific regulations and best practices

#### Lens 9: Lifecycle Analysis
- **Installation**: System setup, configuration, initial data migration
- **Operation**: Normal use patterns, maintenance tasks, monitoring
- **Evolution**: Updates, feature additions, configuration changes
- **Migration**: Data imports/exports, system transitions, legacy integrations
- **Decommissioning**: Data extraction, archival, secure deletion

#### Lens 10: Operational Analysis
**Reasonably Implied Operational Needs**:
1. **Installation & Setup** (if use cases imply deployment): Score +6 if deployment mentioned, +4 otherwise
2. **Data Migration** (if use cases mention existing data): Score +8 if existing data mentioned, +2 otherwise
3. **CI/CD Pipeline** (if use cases imply ongoing development): Score +6 if updates mentioned, +3 otherwise
4. **Operational Monitoring** (if use cases imply production use): Score +4 if production implied, +1 otherwise
5. **Backup & Recovery** (if use cases involve important data): Score +6 if data importance implied, +2 otherwise

**Quality Gate Check - Phase 2**:
- Is each lens discovery based on use case evidence?
- Score each discovered requirement immediately (use scoring system)
- If score < 0, mark as "QUESTIONABLE" and flag for review
- Track: How many discoveries per lens? Are we inventing or discovering?

**Convergence Check**: After applying all lenses, count newly discovered use cases. If discovery rate is <15% compared to previous iteration, proceed to Phase 3.

## Phase 3: Stated Requirements Conversion

**Target Confidence**: 65-75%

**Transform each use case into explicit functional requirements**:

1. **Convert narrative descriptions** into precise "The system shall..." statements
2. **Extract user interactions** and define expected system responses
3. **Identify data inputs and outputs** with validation requirements
4. **Define business rules** and logic constraints explicitly
5. **Specify error handling** and edge case behaviors
6. **Document integration touchpoints** with external systems

**Quality Gate Check - Phase 3**:
For each functional requirement derived:
- **Evidence Test**: Quote the exact use case text driving this requirement
- **Necessity Test**: Would the system fail without this requirement?
- **Complexity Test**: Is this the simplest way to meet the use case need?
- **Scope Test**: Are we adding features not requested in use cases?
- **Score**: Apply full scoring system (Evidence + Complexity)
- If score < 0: Mark as "ASSUMED - Needs Validation"

## Phase 4: Minimal Capability Assessment (NOT Technology Selection)

**Target Confidence**: 70-80%

**Derive capability needs from functional requirements**:

#### Capability Escalation Checklist:
1. **Storage Needs**:
   - Default: File-based storage (JSON, JSONL, CSV, SQLite)
   - Escalate to database ONLY if use cases mention concurrent writes, complex queries, or transactions

2. **Processing Needs**:
   - Default: Client-side or batch processing
   - Escalate to server ONLY if use cases mention shared state, server-side security, or real-time processing

3. **Deployment Needs**:
   - Default: Static hosting or local execution
   - Escalate to cloud/server ONLY if use cases mention availability requirements, remote access, or scheduled execution

**Architecture Complexity Warning**:
If suggesting anything above Level 2, provide:
- Exact use case quote requiring this complexity
- Simpler alternative and why it's insufficient
- Cost/complexity trade-off analysis

## Phase 5: Full Dependency Tree Discovery

**Target Confidence**: 75-82%

**For each identified capability requirement**:

#### Primary Dependency Analysis:
If requirement needs "database capability" →
- Database server/service (or embedded like SQLite)
- Database drivers/clients
- Connection management
- Migration tools
- Backup tools
- Monitoring approach

#### Secondary Dependency Analysis:
For each primary dependency →
- What does IT require?
- Installation prerequisites
- Configuration requirements
- Version compatibility
- Operating system needs

## Phase 6: Iterative Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) Derivation Engine

**Target Confidence**: 80-87%

**Execute systematic NFR discovery cycles** (minimum 9 cycles, maximum 50):

#### Proportional NFR Discovery:
- **Explicit mention** (e.g., "fast", "performance", "speed") → Full performance suite (+8 to +10)
- **Implicit need** (e.g., "interactive", "real-time", "responsive") → Core performance NFRs (+6 to +8)
- **Domain expectation** (e.g., web app, API, CLI tool) → Standard performance NFRs (+4 to +6)
- **No mention** → Minimal baseline performance NFRs (+2 to +4)

#### NFR Categories:
1. **Core Performance Requirements**: Response time, throughput, resource usage
2. **Scalability & Growth Requirements**: Horizontal/vertical scaling, data growth
3. **Security & Privacy Requirements**: Authentication, authorization, data protection
4. **Reliability & Availability Requirements**: Uptime targets, fault tolerance
5. **Usability & Accessibility Requirements**: WCAG compliance, user experience
6. **Maintainability & Supportability Requirements**: Code quality, debugging support

8. **Operational & DevOps Requirements**: Deployment automation, monitoring
9. **Integration & Interoperability Requirements**: API compatibility, data exchange
10. **Business Continuity & Risk Requirements**: Business impact analysis, risk mitigation

**Quality Gate Check for Each NFR**:
- Evidence Check: Is this performance need mentioned, implied, or industry-standard?
- Foundation Check: Can we justify specific thresholds with evidence or best practices?
- Complexity Check: Is the requirement proportional to the system's needs?
- Score: Apply graduated scoring system (-10 to +10)

## Phase 6.5: Industry Baseline NFRs

**Target Confidence**: 82-88%

## Phase 11: Requirement Necessity Validation & Pruning

**Target Confidence**: 94-96%

### Scoring Process:
Review EVERY requirement against quality gates:

2. **Complexity Scoring**: Essential complexity (Keep), Accidental complexity (-2 to -5), Nice-to-have complexity (-1 to -3)
3. **Dependency Cost**: Each unnecessary dependency level (-2), Each required external service (-1)
4. **Final Decision**: Score ≥ 8 (REQUIRED), Score 5-7 (RECOMMENDED), Score 2-4 (SUGGESTED), Score 0-1 (OPTIONAL), Score < 0 (REMOVE)

## Phase 12: Final Validation & Quality Assurance

**Target Confidence**: 95-97%
