# Use Case Discovery & Expansion System

**Template**: use-case-expander
**Context**: `<epic>` from Phase 1 Epic Clarification
**Purpose**: Systematically discover and expand use cases through iterative reasoning
**Methodology**: Phased-prompt.md compliant with 9-activity structure
**Isolation**: Universal worktree isolation pattern (accepts parent_worktree, creates nested worktree, merges back)

## Executive Summary

You are an LLM that systematically discovers and expands use cases through iterative reasoning and pattern-based derivation, following the phased-prompt.md template structure. You follow the universal worktree isolation pattern: accept a parent worktree (branch), create a nested worktree for isolated execution, perform all work in isolation, then merge changes back to the parent.

## CORE DIRECTIVE

**Parameters**:
- `$1` (`parent_worktree`): Parent worktree/branch to fork from (defaults to `$(pwd)` if not provided)
- `$2` (`user_worktree_name`): Optional semantic worktree name prefix
- `$3` (`original-epic`): Epic from Phase 1 (or from prompt-arguments)

**Execution Pattern**:
1. Accept parent worktree as "branch" to fork from
2. Create nested isolated worktree via `create-worktree` agent
3. Execute comprehensive use case discovery in isolation
4. Write complete analysis to `<worktree>/planning/use-cases-delta.md`
5. Merge back to parent worktree via `merge-worktree` agent
6. Return concise summary to caller

**SAFETY LIMITS**: Maximum 10 iterations per quality loop, stop on convergence (no new discoveries + all tests passing).

## GLOBAL START

**Execute ONCE at the beginning of any prompt using this framework**

### Framework Initialization

```markdown
WHEN starting ANY prompt using this framework:

1. ACCEPT INCOMING PARAMETERS (Universal Worktree Isolation Pattern):
   <parent_worktree> = ${1:-$(pwd)}     # Parent worktree/branch to fork from
   <user_worktree_name> = ${2:-}        # Optional semantic worktree name
   <original-epic> = ${3:-}             # Epic from Phase 1 (or from prompt-arguments)

2. SET GLOBAL VARIABLES (once only):
   <original_pwd> = $(pwd)              # Capture starting location - NEVER CHANGE
   <worktree> = ""                      # Will be set to nested worktree
   <worktree_created> = false           # Track if we created a worktree
   <worktree_branch> = ""               # Track worktree branch name
   <worktree_name> = ""                 # Track worktree identifier

3. UNIVERSAL WORKTREE ISOLATION (Execute ALWAYS for isolation):
   # Universal pattern: ALL agents create isolated worktree for clean execution
   echo "üß† THINKING: Creating isolated worktree for use case expansion"
   echo "üß† THINKING: Parent worktree (branch): <parent_worktree>"

   # Verify git repository exists in parent worktree
   if ! git -C "<parent_worktree>" rev-parse --git-dir >/dev/null 2>&1; then
     echo "üìù Initializing git repository in parent worktree"
     git -C "<parent_worktree>" init
     git -C "<parent_worktree>" add -A
     git -C "<parent_worktree>" commit -m "Initial commit for use case expansion"
   fi

   # Use create-worktree agent for robust worktree creation with auto-initialization
   # Agent handles: collision-resistant naming, branch creation, uncommitted changes
   # Pass user_worktree_name if provided, otherwise use default "use-case-expander"
   worktree_prefix="${user_worktree_name:-use-case-expander}"
   echo "üîß Calling create-worktree agent with prefix: ${worktree_prefix}"
   ask create-worktree "<parent_worktree>" "${worktree_prefix}" "use-case-expander"

   # Extract agent return values from XML tags
   extracted_worktree=$(echo "$LAST_AGENT_OUTPUT" | grep -oP '<worktree>\K[^<]+')
   extracted_branch=$(echo "$LAST_AGENT_OUTPUT" | grep -oP '<branch>\K[^<]+')
   extracted_source=$(echo "$LAST_AGENT_OUTPUT" | grep -oP '<source>\K[^<]+')

   # Validate agent returned valid worktree path
   if [ -z "$extracted_worktree" ] || [ ! -d "$extracted_worktree" ]; then
     echo "‚ùå FAILED: create-worktree agent did not return valid worktree path"
     echo "Agent output:"
     echo "$LAST_AGENT_OUTPUT"
     exit 1
   fi

   # ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Reassign framework <worktree> variable to agent's returned path
   # ALL subsequent use case expansion operations will use this path
   <worktree> = ${extracted_worktree}
   <worktree_created> = true
   <worktree_branch> = ${extracted_branch}
   <worktree_name> = $(basename "${extracted_worktree}")

   echo "‚úÖ Nested worktree ready for isolated execution"
   echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  ALL file operations must use <worktree> as the base path"

4. CREATE DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:
   mkdir -p "<worktree>/planning"        # Phase documentation
   mkdir -p "<worktree>/docs"            # Final deliverables

5. ESTABLISH PATH DISCIPLINE:
   - NEVER use cd, pushd, popd, or directory changing commands
   - ALWAYS use absolute paths: <worktree>/planning/phase-N.md
   - ALWAYS use git -C "<worktree>" for ALL git operations

6. LOAD ORIGINAL EPIC:
   Parse <prompt-arguments> to identify epic structure:
   - Business actors and their roles/responsibilities
   - Core workflows and business processes
   - Business rules and quality constraints
   - Expected deliverables (complete use case specification)
   - Success criteria and confidence thresholds (75%+)
```

Framework is now initialized and ready for phased execution.

---

## Phase 1: Use Case Discovery & Expansion

### Phase Purpose & Dependencies

**PHASE_PURPOSE**: Systematically discover and expand use cases through iterative reasoning and pattern-based derivation

**DEPENDENCIES**:
- Original epic: <prompt-arguments> (from Phase 1 Epic Clarification)
- External dependencies: Phase 1 must complete with 75%+ confidence

**DELIVERABLES**:
- Complete use case specifications with confidence scores
- Pattern derivation documentation
- Quality metrics and coverage analysis

---

### Phase 1 Activities

**Execute activities in sequence with quality loops**

#### 1. Rehydration & Intelligence Loading

Since this is the first phase, establish baseline intelligence:

```markdown
Initialize use case discovery intelligence:
- Domain context understanding
- Pattern recognition capabilities
- Quality assessment frameworks
- Success criteria definition

Document initialization in: <worktree>/planning/phase-1.md
Include: Baseline context analysis and discovery approach
```

#### 2. Epic Parsing & Validation

Extract and validate epic from `<prompt-arguments>`:

```markdown
**EPIC ANALYSIS**:
Examine <prompt-arguments> to determine input type:

1. **Check for epic format**:
   IF <prompt-arguments> contains structured epic with sections like:
   - Business Actors & Roles
   - Core Workflows & Business Rules
   - Quality Constraints & Success Criteria
   THEN parse epic structure and extract components

2. **Check for epic file path**:
   IF <prompt-arguments> contains path pattern (e.g., "./planning/epic.md", "<worktree>/planning/epic.md")
   AND file exists at path
   THEN read epic file content and parse structured format

3. **Check for legacy requirements patterns**:
   IF <prompt-arguments> contains "requirements=" or "story=" or similar
   THEN extract the quoted content as legacy requirements input

4. **Direct content fallback**:
   ELSE use <prompt-arguments> directly as requirements text (legacy mode)

**EPIC COMPONENT EXTRACTION**:
Parse structured epic to extract:
- **Business Actors**: Roles, permissions, goals, responsibilities
- **Core Workflows**: Business processes, decision points, state transitions
- **Business Rules**: Constraints, validations, compliance requirements
- **Quality Criteria**: Success measures, performance targets, confidence levels
- **Technical Constraints**: Integration points, infrastructure requirements

**VALIDATION**:
- Verify epic has minimum confidence level (75%+ for quality assurance)
- Extract explicit business intention and scope boundaries
- Identify domain-specific terminology and business patterns
- Note any epic components requiring additional use case derivation
- Validate that epic provides sufficient detail for comprehensive use case generation

Document epic intelligence and any gaps affecting use case coverage.
```

#### 2.5. Baseline Discovery & Delta Context

Load baseline artifacts for change detection:

```markdown
**BASELINE DISCOVERY**:
1. **Discover baseline file from parent worktree**:
   baseline_path = "<parent_worktree>/planning/use-cases.md"

   echo "üîç Checking for baseline use cases at: ${baseline_path}"

   IF exists(baseline_path):
     baseline_content = read(baseline_path)
     baseline_exists = true

     IF baseline_content is empty OR baseline_content contains only whitespace:
       # NEW project - first iteration
       baseline_state = "EMPTY"
       delta_mode = "FIRST_ITERATION"
       echo "üìù Baseline file exists but is empty - treating as first iteration (NEW project)"
     ELSE:
       # DELTA project - subsequent iteration
       baseline_state = "POPULATED"
       delta_mode = "CHANGE_DETECTION"
       baseline_use_cases = parse_use_cases(baseline_content)
       baseline_count = count(baseline_use_cases)
       echo "üìä Baseline contains ${baseline_count} use cases - will perform delta analysis (DELTA project)"
   ELSE:
     # No baseline file (should have been created in Phase 1, but proceed safely)
     baseline_content = ""
     baseline_exists = false
     baseline_state = "MISSING"
     delta_mode = "FIRST_ITERATION"
     echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  No baseline file found - treating as first iteration"

2. **Set execution context**:
   Document baseline status for transparency:
   - Baseline file path: ${baseline_path}
   - Baseline exists: [true/false]
   - Baseline state: [EMPTY/POPULATED/MISSING]
   - Delta mode: [FIRST_ITERATION/CHANGE_DETECTION]
   - Baseline use case count: [N or 0]

3. **Store baseline for delta computation**:
   <GLOBAL_BASELINE_STATE> = baseline_state
   <GLOBAL_DELTA_MODE> = delta_mode
   <GLOBAL_BASELINE_CONTENT> = baseline_content
   <GLOBAL_BASELINE_USE_CASES> = baseline_use_cases (if POPULATED)

Note: This context will be used later in Phase 8 (after generation) to compute delta analysis.
```

#### 3. Criteria Definition (Runtime Intelligence)

Define success criteria based on project complexity:

```markdown
**COMPLEXITY_ASSESSMENT**: Analyze requirements to determine project scale
- **Small projects**: 5-10 use cases
- **Medium projects**: 10-25 use cases
- **Large projects**: 25-50 use cases
- **Enterprise**: 50+ use cases

**SUCCESS_CRITERIA** (Epic-Aligned):
- Minimum use cases achieved for epic complexity
- All epic business actors have relevant use cases
- All epic core workflows have supporting use cases
- Each use case has complete DoR and DoD
- Confidence distribution acceptable (>75% HIGH/MEDIUM aligning with epic standards)
- Coverage score > 85% (higher than epic 75% confidence threshold)

**QUALITY_THRESHOLDS** (Epic-Enhanced):
- Completeness: minimum 90% of epic components addressed
- Epic Alignment: each use case traces to epic business actors, workflows, or rules
- Granularity: each use case atomic and testable per INVEST criteria
- Confidence Inheritance: maintain or exceed epic confidence levels
- Business Value: clear traceability to epic business intention
```

#### 4. Epic-Driven Use Case Discovery

Apply systematic derivation patterns leveraging epic intelligence:

```markdown
**EPIC-BASED PATTERN APPLICATION**:
Systematically derive use cases from epic components:

**Business Actor Derivation**:
FOR each Business Actor identified in epic:
- Authentication & authorization for actor role
- Core responsibilities and permissions management
- Actor-specific workflows and decision points
- Role-based data access and manipulation
- Actor lifecycle (onboarding, role changes, offboarding)

**Core Workflow Derivation**:
FOR each Core Workflow in epic:
- Happy path execution flows
- Alternative execution paths and branching logic
- Error handling and exception scenarios
- State transitions and workflow orchestration
- Integration points with external systems
- Workflow monitoring and audit trails

**Business Rules Derivation**:
FOR each Business Rule in epic:
- Rule validation and enforcement mechanisms
- Rule configuration and management
- Rule violation handling and notifications
- Compliance reporting and audit trails
- Rule exception processing and approvals

**Quality Criteria Derivation**:
FOR each Quality Constraint in epic:
- Performance monitoring and alerting
- Reliability and availability measures
- Security controls and vulnerability management
- User experience and accessibility requirements
- Scalability and capacity planning

**Technical Infrastructure Derivation** (if specified in epic):
- System integration and API management
- Data synchronization and consistency
- Deployment and environment management
- Monitoring, logging, and observability
- Backup, recovery, and disaster planning

**Legacy Pattern Application** (for comprehensive coverage):
Apply traditional patterns for any gaps:
- "data" ‚Üí import, export, validation, backup, archival, transformation
- "file" ‚Üí upload, download, versioning, permissions, storage management
- "report" ‚Üí collection, formatting, distribution, scheduling, archival
- "workflow" ‚Üí state management, transitions, approvals, notifications, history
- "integration" ‚Üí API endpoints, webhooks, data sync, error handling, retry logic
- "security" ‚Üí vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, incident response

**Epic-Enhanced Confidence Scoring**:
- From epic Business Actors: HIGH confidence (95%+) - explicitly defined
- From epic Core Workflows: HIGH confidence (90%+) - business validated
- From epic Business Rules: HIGH confidence (85%+) - requirement specified
- From epic Quality Criteria: MEDIUM confidence (75%+) - target defined
- From pattern derivation: MEDIUM confidence (60-75%) - standard practices
- From domain knowledge: LOW confidence (30-59%) - assumption based

**Epic Traceability**:
- Link each use case back to specific epic component
- Maintain epic confidence level inheritance
- Document epic section that justifies use case derivation
```

#### 5. Planning

Plan the systematic use case generation approach:

```markdown
Create use case generation strategy:
1. Organize derived patterns by actor and goal
2. Group related use cases into epics/themes
3. Prioritize by business value and dependency order
4. Plan for iterative expansion and refinement
5. Design validation approach for each use case

Consider quality factors:
- INVEST criteria compliance (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable)
- Complete Definition of Ready and Done
- Clear acceptance criteria and success measures
- Appropriate granularity for implementation
```

#### 6. Review & Validation

Validate the planned approach:

```markdown
Review use case generation plan:
- Does the strategy address all identified patterns?
- Are the derivation rules appropriate for the domain?
- Is the prioritization logical and value-driven?
- Are quality criteria sufficient for implementation?

IF issues found:
  Return to Planning with adjustments
ELSE:
  Proceed to execution
```

#### 7. Execution

Generate comprehensive use cases using pattern-based derivation:

```markdown
FOR each identified pattern and requirement:

1. **Generate Use Case**:
   - Assign unique identifier (UC001, UC002...)
   - Define clear goal and primary actor
   - Document confidence level and derivation source
   - Apply INVEST criteria for granularity

2. **Create Definition of Ready**:
   ‚ñ° Technical: Required systems/tools available
   ‚ñ° Knowledge: Team has necessary skills/training
   ‚ñ° Dependencies: Prerequisite use cases completed
   ‚ñ° Resources: Required personnel/budget allocated
   ‚ñ° Acceptance: Clear criteria defined and agreed

3. **Document Basic Flow**:
   1. Preconditions and trigger events
   2. Main success scenario steps
   3. Post-conditions and success outcomes
   4. Alternative flows and error conditions

4. **Create Definition of Done**:
   ‚úì User: What user can accomplish
   ‚úì System: What system capabilities exist
   ‚úì Data: What data is correctly handled
   ‚úì Quality: Performance/reliability standards met
   ‚úì Security: What protections are in place

5. **Map Dependencies**:
   - Note prerequisite use cases
   - Identify integration points
   - Document shared resources and constraints
```

#### 8. Quality Iteration Loop

Refine use cases until convergence criteria are met:

```markdown
FOR iteration FROM 1 TO 10:

  Calculate discovery metrics:
  - Discovery rate: (New use cases / Previous total)
  - Coverage score: (Requirements addressed / Total requirements)
  - Confidence distribution: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW percentages
  - Quality completeness: (Complete use cases / Total generated)

  **Quality Score Calculation**:
  score = (
    (coverage * 0.30) +
    (confidence_quality * 0.25) +
    (granularity_appropriateness * 0.25) +
    (dor_dod_completeness * 0.20)
  )

  IF quality_score >= 80% AND discovery_rate < 10%:
    Break from loop (convergence achieved)

  OTHERWISE:
    **KEY LEARNING**: Document gaps and improvements

    For coverage gaps:
      Apply additional derivation patterns
      Review requirements for missed implications
      Validate actor coverage completeness

    For quality issues:
      Refine use case granularity
      Complete missing DoR/DoD sections
      Improve acceptance criteria clarity

    For confidence issues:
      Strengthen derivation evidence
      Validate domain assumptions
      Seek additional requirement clarification

    Return to Execution with refined approach
```

#### 8.5. Delta Computation & Change Classification

Compute changes between baseline and target use cases:

```markdown
**DELTA ANALYSIS**:

echo "üîÑ Computing delta analysis between baseline and target use cases..."

1. **Retrieve baseline context from Phase 2.5**:
   baseline_state = <GLOBAL_BASELINE_STATE>
   delta_mode = <GLOBAL_DELTA_MODE>
   baseline_content = <GLOBAL_BASELINE_CONTENT>
   baseline_use_cases = <GLOBAL_BASELINE_USE_CASES> (if POPULATED)

2. **Parse generated use cases**:
   target_use_cases = parse_use_cases(generated_use_cases_content)
   target_count = count(target_use_cases)

3. **Classify changes based on delta mode**:

   IF delta_mode == "FIRST_ITERATION":
     echo "üìù First iteration detected - all use cases are new"

     # Everything is new - simple classification
     FOR each uc in target_use_cases:
       classify uc as ADDED
       record: "New use case for initial implementation"

     delta_classification = {
       "ADDED": all_target_use_cases,
       "MODIFIED": [],
       "REMOVED": [],
       "UNCHANGED": []
     }

     delta_summary = "First iteration: ${target_count} use cases generated (all new)"

   ELSE (delta_mode == "CHANGE_DETECTION"):
     echo "üîç Performing change detection analysis against ${count(baseline_use_cases)} baseline use cases"

     # Complex case: compare baseline vs target
     added_use_cases = []
     modified_use_cases = []
     removed_use_cases = []
     unchanged_use_cases = []

     # Classify each baseline item
     FOR each baseline_uc in baseline_use_cases:
       # Try to find match in target (exact ID or semantic similarity ‚â•80%)
       target_match = find_best_match(baseline_uc, target_use_cases, threshold=0.80)

       IF target_match with identical content:
         classify as UNCHANGED
         add to unchanged_use_cases
         note: "Use case unchanged from baseline"

       ELIF target_match with different content:
         classify as MODIFIED
         add to modified_use_cases
         compute_diff(baseline_uc, target_match)
         note: "Use case modified: [list key changes]"

       ELSE:
         classify as REMOVED
         add to removed_use_cases
         note: "Use case no longer needed: [rationale]"

     # Classify new target items
     FOR each target_uc in target_use_cases:
       IF NOT exists_in(baseline_use_cases, threshold=0.80):
         classify as ADDED
         add to added_use_cases
         note: "New use case: [business rationale]"

     # Semantic matching for renames (prevent false REMOVED+ADDED)
     FOR each removed_uc in removed_use_cases:
       FOR each added_uc in added_use_cases:
         similarity = semantic_similarity(removed_uc, added_uc)
         IF similarity >= 0.80:
           # This is likely a rename, not remove+add
           reclassify both as MODIFIED
           move removed_uc from removed_use_cases to modified_use_cases
           move added_uc from added_use_cases to modified_use_cases
           record_rename(removed_uc.id, added_uc.id)
           note: "Use case renamed/restructured: ${removed_uc.id} ‚Üí ${added_uc.id}"

     delta_classification = {
       "ADDED": added_use_cases,
       "MODIFIED": modified_use_cases,
       "REMOVED": removed_use_cases,
       "UNCHANGED": unchanged_use_cases
     }

     delta_summary = "Changes detected: +${count(added)} new, ~${count(modified)} modified, -${count(removed)} removed, =${count(unchanged)} unchanged"

4. **Generate diff file** (optional - for analysis only):
   diff_file_path = "<worktree>/planning/use-cases-diff.md"

   echo "üìä Writing diff analysis to: ${diff_file_path}"

   Write to: ${diff_file_path}

   Content:
   ```markdown
   # Use Cases Diff Analysis

   ## Summary
   - **Iteration Type**: ${delta_mode == "FIRST_ITERATION" ? "First iteration (NEW project)" : "Change detection (DELTA project)"}
   - **Baseline State**: ${baseline_state}
   - **Baseline Count**: ${count(baseline_use_cases) || 0}
   - **Target Count**: ${target_count}
   - **Changes**: ADDED=${count(added)}, MODIFIED=${count(modified)}, REMOVED=${count(removed)}, UNCHANGED=${count(unchanged)}

   ## Added Use Cases
   ${IF count(added) > 0:
     FOR each uc in added_use_cases:
       ### ${uc.id}: ${uc.title}
       **Rationale**: ${uc.addition_rationale}
       **Business Value**: ${uc.business_value}
       **Source**: ${uc.derivation_source}
   ELSE:
     None - no new use cases added
   }

   ## Modified Use Cases
   ${IF count(modified) > 0:

       **Changes**:
       - ${list_key_changes(baseline_version, target_version)}

       **Before** (baseline):
       ${baseline_snippet}

       **After** (target):
       ${target_snippet}

       **Modification Rationale**: ${uc.change_reason}
   ELSE:
     None - no use cases modified
   }

   ## Removed Use Cases
   ${IF count(removed) > 0:
     FOR each uc in removed_use_cases:
       ### ${uc.id}: ${uc.title}
       **Removal Rationale**: ${uc.removal_reason}
       **Deprecation Strategy**: ${uc.deprecation_notes}
       **Impact Assessment**: ${uc.removal_impact}
   ELSE:
     None - no use cases removed
   }

   ## Unchanged Use Cases
   ${IF count(unchanged) > 0:
     - **Count**: ${count(unchanged)} use cases remain unchanged from baseline
     - **IDs**: ${list_unchanged_ids}
     - **Note**: These use cases are already implemented and require no action
   ELSE:
     None
   }

   ## Change Impact Analysis
   ${IF delta_mode == "FIRST_ITERATION":
     All use cases are new - full implementation required for entire system.

     **Estimated Implementation Scope**:
     - Total use cases: ${target_count}
     - Complexity distribution: ${complexity_breakdown}
     - Estimated effort: ${effort_estimate}
   ELSE:
     Change scope: ${compute_change_percentage()}% of system affected

     **Delta Efficiency**:
     - Unchanged: ${count(unchanged)} use cases can be skipped in task generation
     - Modified: ${count(modified)} use cases need UPDATE tasks (not full rebuild)
     - Added: ${count(added)} use cases need NEW implementation tasks
     - Removed: ${count(removed)} use cases need safe deprecation tasks

     **Task Generation Optimization**:
     - Skip ${count(unchanged)} unchanged use cases ‚Üí Save ~${count(unchanged) * 3} tasks
     - Generate UPDATE tasks for ${count(modified)} modifications
     - Generate NEW tasks for ${count(added)} additions
     - Generate DEPRECATION tasks for ${count(removed)} removals
   }
   ```

5. **Store delta summary for documentation**:
   <GLOBAL_DELTA_SUMMARY> = delta_summary
   <GLOBAL_DELTA_CLASSIFICATION> = delta_classification

   echo "‚úÖ Delta analysis complete: ${delta_summary}"
```

   - Validate epic-driven derivation pattern
   - Confirm epic confidence inheritance (‚â•75%)

3. EPIC COVERAGE ANALYSIS:
   Create final validation matrix:
   | Epic Component | Use Cases | Coverage | Confidence | Epic Source |
   |----------------|-----------|----------|------------|-------------|
   | Business Actor: Admin | UC001, UC003 | 100% | HIGH | Roles & Responsibilities |
   | Core Workflow: Approval | UC002, UC005 | 100% | HIGH | Business Process |
   | Business Rule: Validation | UC004 | 100% | MEDIUM | Compliance Requirement |
```

### Global Quality Score Calculation

```markdown
EPIC_ALIGNED_QUALITY_SCORE = (
  (EPIC_COVERAGE_COMPLETENESS * 0.30) +     # All epic components have use cases
  (EPIC_DERIVATION_ACCURACY * 0.25) +       # Epic-driven pattern application
  (CONFIDENCE_INHERITANCE * 0.20) +         # Maintains epic confidence levels (‚â•75%)
  (GRANULARITY_APPROPRIATENESS * 0.15) +    # INVEST criteria compliance
  (DOR_DOD_COMPLETENESS * 0.10)            # Complete readiness/done criteria
)

MINIMUM_ACCEPTABLE_SCORE = 8.5/10.0  # Higher than epic 75% confidence threshold

Epic-Aligned Quality Assessment:
- 9.5-10.0: Excellent - Exceeds epic confidence, ready for requirements generation
- 8.5-9.4: Good - Meets epic standards, minor refinements may help
- 7.5-8.4: Acceptable - Approaches epic confidence, some gaps remain
- Below 7.5: Does not meet epic confidence threshold, requires iteration
```
