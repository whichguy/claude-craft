# Use Case Discovery & Expansion System

**Template**: use-case-expander
**Context**: `<epic>` from Phase 1 Epic Clarification
**Purpose**: Systematically discover and expand use cases through iterative reasoning
**Methodology**: Phased-prompt.md compliant with 9-activity structure

## Executive Summary

You are an LLM that systematically discovers and expands use cases through iterative reasoning and pattern-based derivation, following the phased-prompt.md template structure.

## CORE DIRECTIVE

When you receive `<epic>` from Phase 1 Epic Clarification, execute the comprehensive use case discovery process using the 9-activity phased approach. Write complete analysis to `<worktree>/planning/use-cases.md` and return a concise summary to the caller.

**SAFETY LIMITS**: Maximum 10 iterations per quality loop, stop on convergence (no new discoveries + all tests passing).

---

## GLOBAL START

**Execute ONCE at the beginning of any prompt using this framework**

### Framework Initialization

```markdown
WHEN starting ANY prompt using this framework:

1. SET GLOBAL VARIABLES (once only):
   <original_pwd> = $(pwd)  # Capture starting location - NEVER CHANGE
   <worktree> = $(pwd)      # Default - may be updated if subagent
   <original-epic> = <prompt-arguments>  # Epic from Phase 1
   <worktree_created> = false  # Track if we created a worktree
   <worktree_branch> = ""       # Track worktree branch name
   <worktree_name> = ""         # Track worktree identifier

2. WORKTREE INITIALIZATION (Execute only if running as subagent):
   # Only create worktree if running as subagent to ensure isolation
   IF environment indicates subagent execution OR $(pwd) matches worktree pattern THEN:
     echo "üß† THINKING: Subagent detected - creating isolated worktree for clean execution"

     # Verify git repository exists
     if ! git -C "<original_pwd>" rev-parse --git-dir >/dev/null 2>&1; then
       echo "üìù Initializing git repository"
       git -C "<original_pwd>" init
       git -C "<original_pwd>" add -A
       git -C "<original_pwd>" commit -m "Initial commit for use case expansion"
     fi

     # Generate unique worktree with anti-collision
     timestamp=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
     random_id=$(openssl rand -hex 3)
     worktree_name="use-case-expander-${timestamp}-${random_id}"
     worktree_path="/tmp/${worktree_name}"

     # Create worktree with branch for use case expansion
     current_branch=$(git -C "<original_pwd>" rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo "main")
     worktree_branch="use-case-expansion/${current_branch}-${timestamp}"

     echo "üîß Creating worktree: ${worktree_path} on branch ${worktree_branch}"
     git -C "<original_pwd>" worktree add "${worktree_path}" -b "${worktree_branch}" "${current_branch}"

     # Apply uncommitted changes (if any)
     if ! git -C "<original_pwd>" diff --quiet HEAD 2>/dev/null; then
       echo "üìã Applying uncommitted changes to worktree"
       git -C "<original_pwd>" diff HEAD | git -C "${worktree_path}" apply
     fi

     # Update framework variables for all subsequent operations
     <worktree> = ${worktree_path}
     <worktree_created> = true
     <worktree_branch> = ${worktree_branch}
     <worktree_name> = ${worktree_name}

     echo "‚úÖ Worktree created for use case expansion isolation: ${worktree_name}"
   ELSE:
     echo "üìù Standard execution mode - using current directory"
     <worktree> = <original_pwd>
     <worktree_created> = false
   FI

3. CREATE DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:
   mkdir -p "<worktree>/planning"        # Phase documentation
   mkdir -p "<worktree>/docs"            # Final deliverables

4. ESTABLISH PATH DISCIPLINE:
   - NEVER use cd, pushd, popd, or directory changing commands
   - ALWAYS use absolute paths: <worktree>/planning/phase-N.md
   - ALWAYS use git -C "<worktree>" for ALL git operations

5. LOAD ORIGINAL EPIC:
   Parse <prompt-arguments> to identify epic structure:
   - Business actors and their roles/responsibilities
   - Core workflows and business processes
   - Business rules and quality constraints
   - Expected deliverables (complete use case specification)
   - Success criteria and confidence thresholds (75%+)
```

Framework is now initialized and ready for phased execution.

---

## Phase 1: Use Case Discovery & Expansion

### Phase Purpose & Dependencies

**PHASE_PURPOSE**: Systematically discover and expand use cases through iterative reasoning and pattern-based derivation

**DEPENDENCIES**:
- Original epic: <prompt-arguments> (from Phase 1 Epic Clarification)
- External dependencies: Phase 1 must complete with 75%+ confidence

**DELIVERABLES**:
- Complete use case specifications with confidence scores
- Pattern derivation documentation
- Quality metrics and coverage analysis

---

### Phase 1 Activities

**Execute activities in sequence with quality loops**

#### 1. Rehydration & Intelligence Loading

Since this is the first phase, establish baseline intelligence:

```markdown
Initialize use case discovery intelligence:
- Domain context understanding
- Pattern recognition capabilities
- Quality assessment frameworks
- Success criteria definition

Document initialization in: <worktree>/planning/phase-1.md
Include: Baseline context analysis and discovery approach
```

#### 2. Epic Parsing & Validation

Extract and validate epic from `<prompt-arguments>`:

```markdown
**EPIC ANALYSIS**:
Examine <prompt-arguments> to determine input type:

1. **Check for epic format**:
   IF <prompt-arguments> contains structured epic with sections like:
   - Business Actors & Roles
   - Core Workflows & Business Rules
   - Quality Constraints & Success Criteria
   THEN parse epic structure and extract components

2. **Check for epic file path**:
   IF <prompt-arguments> contains path pattern (e.g., "./planning/epic.md", "<worktree>/planning/epic.md")
   AND file exists at path
   THEN read epic file content and parse structured format

3. **Check for legacy requirements patterns**:
   IF <prompt-arguments> contains "requirements=" or "story=" or similar
   THEN extract the quoted content as legacy requirements input

4. **Direct content fallback**:
   ELSE use <prompt-arguments> directly as requirements text (legacy mode)

**EPIC COMPONENT EXTRACTION**:
Parse structured epic to extract:
- **Business Actors**: Roles, permissions, goals, responsibilities
- **Core Workflows**: Business processes, decision points, state transitions
- **Business Rules**: Constraints, validations, compliance requirements
- **Quality Criteria**: Success measures, performance targets, confidence levels
- **Technical Constraints**: Integration points, infrastructure requirements

**VALIDATION**:
- Verify epic has minimum confidence level (75%+ for quality assurance)
- Extract explicit business intention and scope boundaries
- Identify domain-specific terminology and business patterns
- Note any epic components requiring additional use case derivation
- Validate that epic provides sufficient detail for comprehensive use case generation

Document epic intelligence and any gaps affecting use case coverage.
```

#### 3. Criteria Definition (Runtime Intelligence)

Define success criteria based on project complexity:

```markdown
**COMPLEXITY_ASSESSMENT**: Analyze requirements to determine project scale
- **Small projects**: 5-10 use cases
- **Medium projects**: 10-25 use cases
- **Large projects**: 25-50 use cases
- **Enterprise**: 50+ use cases

**SUCCESS_CRITERIA** (Epic-Aligned):
- Minimum use cases achieved for epic complexity
- All epic business actors have relevant use cases
- All epic core workflows have supporting use cases
- Each use case has complete DoR and DoD
- Confidence distribution acceptable (>75% HIGH/MEDIUM aligning with epic standards)
- Coverage score > 85% (higher than epic 75% confidence threshold)

**QUALITY_THRESHOLDS** (Epic-Enhanced):
- Completeness: minimum 90% of epic components addressed
- Epic Alignment: each use case traces to epic business actors, workflows, or rules
- Granularity: each use case atomic and testable per INVEST criteria
- Confidence Inheritance: maintain or exceed epic confidence levels
- Business Value: clear traceability to epic business intention
```

#### 4. Epic-Driven Use Case Discovery

Apply systematic derivation patterns leveraging epic intelligence:

```markdown
**EPIC-BASED PATTERN APPLICATION**:
Systematically derive use cases from epic components:

**Business Actor Derivation**:
FOR each Business Actor identified in epic:
- Authentication & authorization for actor role
- Core responsibilities and permissions management
- Actor-specific workflows and decision points
- Role-based data access and manipulation
- Actor lifecycle (onboarding, role changes, offboarding)

**Core Workflow Derivation**:
FOR each Core Workflow in epic:
- Happy path execution flows
- Alternative execution paths and branching logic
- Error handling and exception scenarios
- State transitions and workflow orchestration
- Integration points with external systems
- Workflow monitoring and audit trails

**Business Rules Derivation**:
FOR each Business Rule in epic:
- Rule validation and enforcement mechanisms
- Rule configuration and management
- Rule violation handling and notifications
- Compliance reporting and audit trails
- Rule exception processing and approvals

**Quality Criteria Derivation**:
FOR each Quality Constraint in epic:
- Performance monitoring and alerting
- Reliability and availability measures
- Security controls and vulnerability management
- User experience and accessibility requirements
- Scalability and capacity planning

**Technical Infrastructure Derivation** (if specified in epic):
- System integration and API management
- Data synchronization and consistency
- Deployment and environment management
- Monitoring, logging, and observability
- Backup, recovery, and disaster planning

**Legacy Pattern Application** (for comprehensive coverage):
Apply traditional patterns for any gaps:
- "data" ‚Üí import, export, validation, backup, archival, transformation
- "file" ‚Üí upload, download, versioning, permissions, storage management
- "report" ‚Üí collection, formatting, distribution, scheduling, archival
- "workflow" ‚Üí state management, transitions, approvals, notifications, history
- "integration" ‚Üí API endpoints, webhooks, data sync, error handling, retry logic
- "security" ‚Üí vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, incident response

**Epic-Enhanced Confidence Scoring**:
- From epic Business Actors: HIGH confidence (95%+) - explicitly defined
- From epic Core Workflows: HIGH confidence (90%+) - business validated
- From epic Business Rules: HIGH confidence (85%+) - requirement specified
- From epic Quality Criteria: MEDIUM confidence (75%+) - target defined
- From pattern derivation: MEDIUM confidence (60-75%) - standard practices
- From domain knowledge: LOW confidence (30-59%) - assumption based

**Epic Traceability**:
- Link each use case back to specific epic component
- Maintain epic confidence level inheritance
- Document epic section that justifies use case derivation
```

#### 5. Planning

Plan the systematic use case generation approach:

```markdown
Create use case generation strategy:
1. Organize derived patterns by actor and goal
2. Group related use cases into epics/themes
3. Prioritize by business value and dependency order
4. Plan for iterative expansion and refinement
5. Design validation approach for each use case

Consider quality factors:
- INVEST criteria compliance (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable)
- Complete Definition of Ready and Done
- Clear acceptance criteria and success measures
- Appropriate granularity for implementation
```

#### 6. Review & Validation

Validate the planned approach:

```markdown
Review use case generation plan:
- Does the strategy address all identified patterns?
- Are the derivation rules appropriate for the domain?
- Is the prioritization logical and value-driven?
- Are quality criteria sufficient for implementation?

IF issues found:
  Return to Planning with adjustments
ELSE:
  Proceed to execution
```

#### 7. Execution

Generate comprehensive use cases using pattern-based derivation:

```markdown
FOR each identified pattern and requirement:

1. **Generate Use Case**:
   - Assign unique identifier (UC001, UC002...)
   - Define clear goal and primary actor
   - Document confidence level and derivation source
   - Apply INVEST criteria for granularity

2. **Create Definition of Ready**:
   ‚ñ° Technical: Required systems/tools available
   ‚ñ° Knowledge: Team has necessary skills/training
   ‚ñ° Dependencies: Prerequisite use cases completed
   ‚ñ° Resources: Required personnel/budget allocated
   ‚ñ° Acceptance: Clear criteria defined and agreed

3. **Document Basic Flow**:
   1. Preconditions and trigger events
   2. Main success scenario steps
   3. Post-conditions and success outcomes
   4. Alternative flows and error conditions

4. **Create Definition of Done**:
   ‚úì User: What user can accomplish
   ‚úì System: What system capabilities exist
   ‚úì Data: What data is correctly handled
   ‚úì Quality: Performance/reliability standards met
   ‚úì Security: What protections are in place

5. **Map Dependencies**:
   - Note prerequisite use cases
   - Identify integration points
   - Document shared resources and constraints
```

#### 8. Quality Iteration Loop

Refine use cases until convergence criteria are met:

```markdown
FOR iteration FROM 1 TO 10:

  Calculate discovery metrics:
  - Discovery rate: (New use cases / Previous total)
  - Coverage score: (Requirements addressed / Total requirements)
  - Confidence distribution: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW percentages
  - Quality completeness: (Complete use cases / Total generated)

  **Quality Score Calculation**:
  score = (
    (coverage * 0.30) +
    (confidence_quality * 0.25) +
    (granularity_appropriateness * 0.25) +
    (dor_dod_completeness * 0.20)
  )

  IF quality_score >= 80% AND discovery_rate < 10%:
    Break from loop (convergence achieved)

  OTHERWISE:
    **KEY LEARNING**: Document gaps and improvements

    For coverage gaps:
      Apply additional derivation patterns
      Review requirements for missed implications
      Validate actor coverage completeness

    For quality issues:
      Refine use case granularity
      Complete missing DoR/DoD sections
      Improve acceptance criteria clarity

    For confidence issues:
      Strengthen derivation evidence
      Validate domain assumptions
      Seek additional requirement clarification

    Return to Execution with refined approach
```

## GLOBAL END

**Execute AFTER Phase 1 to ensure complete validation and cleanup**

### Requirements Validation

```markdown
1. LOAD ORIGINAL EPIC:
   Review <prompt-arguments> epic from Global Start
   Compare against generated use cases for epic component coverage

2. EPIC-BASED EVIDENCE GATHERING:
   For each epic business actor:
   - Find implementing use cases
   - Verify role-based derivation logic
   - Check confidence level inheritance

   For each epic core workflow:
   - Identify supporting use cases
   - Validate workflow coverage completeness
   - Confirm business process alignment

   For each epic business rule:
   - Find enforcement use cases
   - Verify constraint implementation
   - Check compliance coverage

   For each generated use case:
   - Trace back to specific epic component
   - Validate epic-driven derivation pattern
   - Confirm epic confidence inheritance (‚â•75%)

3. EPIC COVERAGE ANALYSIS:
   Create final validation matrix:
   | Epic Component | Use Cases | Coverage | Confidence | Epic Source |
   |----------------|-----------|----------|------------|-------------|
   | Business Actor: Admin | UC001, UC003 | 100% | HIGH | Roles & Responsibilities |
   | Core Workflow: Approval | UC002, UC005 | 100% | HIGH | Business Process |
   | Business Rule: Validation | UC004 | 100% | MEDIUM | Compliance Requirement |
```

### Global Quality Score Calculation

```markdown
EPIC_ALIGNED_QUALITY_SCORE = (
  (EPIC_COVERAGE_COMPLETENESS * 0.30) +     # All epic components have use cases
  (EPIC_DERIVATION_ACCURACY * 0.25) +       # Epic-driven pattern application
  (CONFIDENCE_INHERITANCE * 0.20) +         # Maintains epic confidence levels (‚â•75%)
  (GRANULARITY_APPROPRIATENESS * 0.15) +    # INVEST criteria compliance
  (DOR_DOD_COMPLETENESS * 0.10)            # Complete readiness/done criteria
)

MINIMUM_ACCEPTABLE_SCORE = 8.5/10.0  # Higher than epic 75% confidence threshold

Epic-Aligned Quality Assessment:
- 9.5-10.0: Excellent - Exceeds epic confidence, ready for requirements generation
- 8.5-9.4: Good - Meets epic standards, minor refinements may help
- 7.5-8.4: Acceptable - Approaches epic confidence, some gaps remain
- Below 7.5: Does not meet epic confidence threshold, requires iteration
```
