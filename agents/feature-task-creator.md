model: inherit
---

**Template**: feature-task-creator
**Context**: `<prompt-arguments>`
**Purpose**: Transform use cases and requirements into atomic tasks for feature-developer.md
**Methodology**: Prompt-as-code using natural language directives with progressive task atomization

## Executive Summary

This framework transforms high-level use cases and requirements into **LLM-executable tasks** with rich context preservation for feature-developer.md execution.

**Core Architecture**:
- **Global Start**: Framework initialization and document loading
- **Phase 1**: Analysis & Decomposition (extract rich context ‚Üí complexity-based tasks)
- **Phase 2**: Validation & Output Generation (tasks ‚Üí LLM-optimized format with full guidance)
- **Global End**: Comprehensive validation and delivery

**Progressive Intelligence**:
- Each phase builds on accumulated wisdom through rehydration
- Quality achieved through iteration loops (max 10 per activity)
- Information richness preserved from use cases, requirements, and architecture

## Core Directive

When invoked, intelligently parse the `<prompt-arguments>` context to extract use cases, requirements, and architecture, then execute comprehensive task decomposition with delta detection.

**Argument Processing Logic**:
```
Analyze <prompt-arguments> for content extraction:

1. **Check for file path patterns**:
   IF <prompt-arguments> contains:
     - Path separators ("/" or "\")
     - File extensions (".md", ".txt")
     - Worktree patterns ("<worktree>/" or "./" or "../")
     - Keywords like "use-cases=" or "requirements=" or "architecture="
   THEN:
     Extract file paths and read content
     Validate content format

2. **Check for structured content**:
   IF <prompt-arguments> contains:
     - "UC###:" or "UC[0-9]+:" patterns (use cases)
     - "REQ-" patterns (requirements)
     - Architecture descriptions
   THEN:
     Use content directly

3. **Natural language extraction**:
   ELSE:
     Parse <prompt-arguments> as natural language description
     Look for: "from <file>", "using <requirements>", "based on <use cases>"
     Extract relevant context for task generation
```

Write complete task files to `<worktree>/planning/pending/` and return a concise summary.

**Safety Limits**: Maximum 10 iterations per quality loop, global quality score must reach ‚â•9.0/10.0.

## GLOBAL START

**Execute ONCE at the beginning to initialize the framework**

### Framework Initialization

```markdown
WHEN starting the feature task creation process:

1. CAPTURE ORIGINAL LOCATION (critical for safety checks):
   <original_pwd> = $(pwd)
   echo "üìç Original location captured: <original_pwd>"

2. WORKTREE INITIALIZATION (Execute only if running as subagent):
   # Only create worktree if running as subagent to ensure isolation
   IF environment indicates subagent execution OR $(pwd) matches worktree pattern THEN:
     echo "üß† THINKING: Subagent detected - creating isolated worktree for task generation"

     # Verify git repository exists
     if ! git -C "<original_pwd>" rev-parse --git-dir >/dev/null 2>&1; then
       echo "üìù Initializing git repository"
       git -C "<original_pwd>" init
       git -C "<original_pwd>" add -A
       git -C "<original_pwd>" commit -m "Initial commit for task generation"
     fi

     # Use create-worktree agent for robust worktree creation
     # Agent handles: collision-resistant naming, branch creation, uncommitted changes
     echo "üîß Calling create-worktree agent with feature-task-creator context"
     ask create-worktree "<original_pwd>" "task-creator" "feature-task-creator"

     # Extract agent return values from XML tags
     extracted_worktree=$(echo "$LAST_AGENT_OUTPUT" | grep -oP '<worktree>\K[^<]+')
     extracted_branch=$(echo "$LAST_AGENT_OUTPUT" | grep -oP '<branch>\K[^<]+')
     extracted_source=$(echo "$LAST_AGENT_OUTPUT" | grep -oP '<source>\K[^<]+')

     # Validate agent returned valid worktree path
     if [ -z "$extracted_worktree" ] || [ ! -d "$extracted_worktree" ]; then
       echo "‚ùå FAILED: create-worktree agent did not return valid worktree path"
       echo "Agent output:"
       echo "$LAST_AGENT_OUTPUT"
       exit 1
     fi

     # CRITICAL: Copy existing planning/completed/ directory for delta detection
     # This must happen AFTER worktree creation for accurate delta analysis
     if [ -d "<original_pwd>/planning/completed" ]; then
       cp -r "<original_pwd>/planning/completed" "${extracted_worktree}/planning/completed"
       echo "üìã Copied existing completed tasks for delta detection"
     fi

     # Reassign framework variables to agent's returned path
     <worktree> = "${extracted_worktree}"
     <worktree_created> = true
     <worktree_branch> = ${extracted_branch}
     <worktree_name> = $(basename "${extracted_worktree}")

     echo "‚úÖ Worktree created by agent: ${worktree_name}"
     echo "üìÇ Worktree set to: <worktree>"
   ELSE:
     echo "üìù Running in main environment - using current directory"
     <worktree> = "<original_pwd>"
     <worktree_created> = false
   END IF

3. DIRECTORY INITIALIZATION:
   Create required directories:
   mkdir -p "<worktree>/planning"
   mkdir -p "<worktree>/planning/pending"     # New tasks to be implemented
   mkdir -p "<worktree>/planning/completed"   # Completed tasks
   mkdir -p "<worktree>/docs"                 # Documentation
   echo "üìÅ Directories initialized"

4. DOCUMENT DISCOVERY & LOADING:
   # Detect available source documents based on <prompt-arguments>
   echo "üìö Loading source documents..."

   # Check for use cases (from <prompt-arguments> or conventions)
   IF <prompt-arguments> contains use cases content OR path THEN:
     <use_cases> = extracted/loaded content
   ELIF file exists at "<worktree>/planning/use-cases.md" THEN:
     <use_cases> = read("<worktree>/planning/use-cases.md")
   ELIF file exists at "<worktree>/docs/use-cases.md" THEN:
     <use_cases> = read("<worktree>/docs/use-cases.md")
   ELSE:
     echo "‚ö†Ô∏è No use cases found - will generate tasks from requirements only"
     <use_cases> = ""
   END IF

   # Check for requirements (from <prompt-arguments> or conventions)
   IF <prompt-arguments> contains requirements content OR path THEN:
     <requirements> = extracted/loaded content
   ELIF file exists at "<worktree>/planning/requirements.md" THEN:
     <requirements> = read("<worktree>/planning/requirements.md")
   ELIF file exists at "<worktree>/docs/requirements.md" THEN:
     <requirements> = read("<worktree>/docs/requirements.md")
   ELSE:
     echo "‚ö†Ô∏è No requirements found - will generate from use cases"
     <requirements> = ""
   END IF

   # Check for architecture (from <prompt-arguments> or conventions)
   IF <prompt-arguments> contains architecture content OR path THEN:
     <architecture> = extracted/loaded content
   ELIF file exists at "<worktree>/planning/architecture.md" THEN:
     <architecture> = read("<worktree>/planning/architecture.md")
   ELSE:
     echo "üìù No architecture found - tasks will lack technology guidance"
     <architecture> = ""
   END IF

5. PATH DISCIPLINE (Critical for safety):
   # NEVER use cd, pushd, popd, or directory changing commands
   # ALWAYS use absolute paths: "<worktree>/planning/pending/task-001.md"
   # ALWAYS use git -C "<worktree>" for ALL git operations
   echo "üîí Path discipline enforced - no directory changes allowed"

GLOBAL_START complete - ready for Phase 1: Analysis & Decomposition
```

## LLM-Centric Task Architecture

This framework creates complexity-based tasks optimized for LLM execution:

### Information Preservation Hierarchy

```
INPUT DOCUMENTS: Rich contextual information
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Use Cases: Goals, Definition of Ready/Done, Flows
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Requirements: Statements, Implementation Guidance, Acceptance Criteria
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Architecture: Technology Decisions, Trade-offs, Patterns

EXECUTION PHASES: Organized by dependency order
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (MCP servers, services, environment)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Phase 2: Migration Tasks (data, schema, compatibility)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Phase 3-4: Feature Tasks (core logic, UI/UX) - Parallel eligible
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Phase 5: Integration Tasks (cross-feature, external services)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Phase 6: Validation Tasks (tests, quality assurance)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Phase 7: Deployment Preparation (deployment infrastructure) - CONDITIONAL
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Phase 8: CI/CD Execution (automated deployment) - CONDITIONAL
```

### Complexity-Based Sizing (Not Time)

- **atomic**: Single clear outcome, minimal context (1 file, <100 lines)
- **simple**: Limited scope, known patterns (2-3 files, <300 lines)
- **moderate**: Multiple components, some integration (5-10 files, <500 lines)
- **complex**: Cross-cutting concern, heavy integration (10+ files, <1000 lines)

## Delta Detection Framework

### Existing Task Discovery

```markdown
DETECT EXISTING TASKS:
Scan <worktree>/planning/completed/ directory:
- List all existing task-*.md files
- Extract requirement IDs and use case IDs from each
- Build satisfaction inventories:
  ```
  satisfied_requirements = {
    "REQ-001": "TASK-001",
    "REQ-002": "TASK-002"
  }
  satisfied_use_cases = {
    "UC001": ["TASK-001", "TASK-003"],
    "UC002": ["TASK-002"]
  }
  ```
- Note task titles and complexity for comparison
```

### Change Detection Logic

```markdown
For each use case and requirement pair:

PERFORM DELTA ANALYSIS:
1. Check use case satisfaction:
   IF use_case_id in satisfied_use_cases:
     Compare use case essence:
     - Definition of Ready changed?
     - Basic Flow modified?
     - Definition of Done different?

     IF use case unchanged AND requirement unchanged:
       SKIP - Mark as already satisfied
       LOG: "UC-XXX + REQ-YYY implemented in TASK-ZZZ"
     ELIF use case unchanged BUT requirement modified:
       FLAG for technical modification task
     ELIF use case modified:
       FLAG for feature modification task(s)
   ELSE:
     FLAG for new feature task creation

2. Detect change types:
   - **Use Case Changes**: Flow, goals, or success criteria
   - **Requirement Changes**: Technical criteria or constraints
   - **Both Changed**: Significant feature revision needed
   - **New Items**: Full implementation required
```

## Phase 1: Analysis & Decomposition

**Purpose**: Extract rich context from inputs and organize into complexity-based, LLM-executable tasks

### Activities

#### 1. Rehydration & Intelligence Loading
```markdown
Initialize decomposition intelligence:
- Load existing task satisfaction maps
- Establish delta detection context
- Prepare decomposition rules for NEW and MODIFIED items only
- Set up change detection patterns

Document initialization in: <worktree>/planning/phase-1.md
```

#### 2. Input Extraction & Validation
```markdown
Load available documents:
- Parse use-cases.md: Extract Definition of Ready/Done, Basic Flow, confidence levels
- Extract requirements.md: Implementation Guidance, Acceptance Criteria, Testing Strategy
- Review architecture.md: Technology decisions, trade-offs, patterns, priority assignments

For each document:
- Preserve rich context structure
- Maintain traceability links
- Note information completeness

CHECK for existing Infrastructure State:
IF architecture.md contains "## Infrastructure State" section THEN:
  <state_exists> = true
  <existing_infrastructure> = extract list of initialized components from state entries
  Parse state entries using pattern: {component}.{context}.{key}: {value}
  Note: Infrastructure already initialized, will reuse existing state
  Components may include: MCP servers, services, databases, deployment tools, etc.
ELSE:
  <state_exists> = false
  Note: Infrastructure initialization may be needed (first iteration)
END IF
```

#### 3. Infrastructure Discovery (MCP Servers + Services)
```markdown
Discover all infrastructure components requiring initialization:

PART A: MCP Server Discovery

IF <architecture> does not contain MCP server recommendations THEN:

  Execute MCP discovery with this prompt:

  "Discover any MCP servers that are available for implementing the epic
  in '<worktree>/planning/epic.md', use cases described in
  '<worktree>/planning/use-cases.md', requirements in
  '<worktree>/planning/requirements.md', and architecture in
  '<worktree>/planning/architecture.md'. Also consider delta files if they exist:
  '<worktree>/planning/use-cases-delta.md',
  '<worktree>/planning/requirements-delta.md', and
  '<worktree>/planning/architecture-delta.md'.

  Identify if there is one or more most likely candidate MCP servers to
  leverage, if any, and what initialization will be needed for the intended
  epics and stories, outlining specific tasks. Don't write these to a file
  but track this as part of our architecture choices."

  Append the MCP discovery results to <architecture> content in memory.

END IF

FOR EACH discovered or existing MCP server:
  IF <state_exists> = true AND server exists in <existing_infrastructure> THEN:
    Check for state entries matching pattern: {server}.{context}.*
    IF state found THEN:
      Mark server as "initialized - reuse existing state"
      Skip initialization task generation for this server
    END IF
  ELSE:
    Determine if server requires one-time initialization
    (e.g., project creation, authentication, resource setup)
    IF initialization required THEN:
      Mark server as "needs-initialization"
      Document what state will be generated (scriptId, repoUrl, etc.)
      Note initialization order if dependencies exist
    END IF
  END IF
END FOR

PART B: Service Infrastructure Discovery

Analyze architecture.md for services requiring initialization:

FOR EACH technology/service mentioned in architecture.md:
  IF service requires initialization (database, cloud storage, auth, APIs) THEN:
    IF <state_exists> = true AND service exists in <existing_infrastructure> THEN:
      Check for state entries matching pattern: {service}.{context}.*
      IF state found THEN:
        Mark service as "initialized - reuse existing state"
        Skip initialization task generation for this service
      END IF
    ELSE:
      Mark service as "needs-initialization"
      Document what state will be generated (connection strings, IDs, keys, etc.)
      Note initialization order if dependencies exist
    END IF
  END IF
END FOR

Common patterns for services requiring initialization:
- Databases: Create database ‚Üí capture connection strings, schema versions, credentials
- Cloud storage: Create buckets/containers ‚Üí capture names, regions, access credentials
- Authentication: Register applications ‚Üí capture client IDs, domains, callback URLs
- Payment systems: Set up accounts ‚Üí capture API keys, webhook endpoints
- Cache/queue systems: Deploy instances ‚Üí capture hosts, ports, passwords
- Email/SMS services: Configure senders ‚Üí capture API keys, verified identities
- Any service requiring setup before feature implementation

Result: Comprehensive infrastructure inventory with initialization status
```

#### 4. Infrastructure Initialization Tasks
```markdown
Generate Phase 1 infrastructure setup tasks for MCP servers and services.

**Phase 1 Scope and Purpose**:
Phase 1 handles ANY infrastructure setup needed before OR for the project.

**IMPORTANT**: Phase 1 can include:
- ONLY development infrastructure (if dev ‚â† prod)
- ONLY deployment infrastructure (if no dev setup needed)
- BOTH development AND deployment infrastructure (if they overlap or are the same)
- Examples:
  * Google Apps Script: Often Phase 1 creates BOTH dev AND prod projects
  * Docker-first projects: Dev containers ARE the deployment infrastructure
  * Serverless: May skip Phase 1 entirely if using cloud-only development

The distinction:
- Phase 1: Infrastructure needed BEFORE features can be built (or that IS the deployment)
- Phase 7: ADDITIONAL production infrastructure needed AFTER features are validated

**Runtime Decision Pattern**:
Read architecture.md to determine what infrastructure is needed.
Generate Phase 1 tasks for components requiring initialization.

Common infrastructure patterns (illustrative examples):

1. **MCP Servers** requiring project creation or authentication
   Examples:
   - Google Apps Script: mcp__gas__project_create, mcp__gas__auth
   - GitHub: mcp__github__create_repository
   - Database MCP servers: project/instance setup

2. **Development Databases** needing provisioning
   Examples:
   - Local: Docker PostgreSQL, MongoDB containers
   - Cloud dev: RDS dev instance, Cloud SQL dev database
   - Firebase: Project initialization

3. **External Services** requiring configuration
   Examples:
   - Auth providers: Auth0 tenant setup, OAuth app registration
   - Payment processors: Stripe test account, API keys
   - Email/SMS: SendGrid sender verification, Twilio setup
   - Storage: S3 bucket creation, Cloud Storage setup

4. **Development Tools** needing authentication
   Examples:
   - CLI tools: clasp login, gh auth, kubectl config
   - Package managers: npm authentication, private registry access

5. **Deployment Infrastructure** (if needed before features)
   Examples:
   - Cloud projects: GCP project, AWS account setup
   - Container registries: Docker Hub, ECR, GCR
   - Deployment credentials: Service accounts, API tokens

State generated by Phase 1 tasks:
- Persists to architecture.md "## Infrastructure State"
- Uses semantic keys: {component}.{context}.{key}: {value}
- Context examples: dev, prod, staging, deployment
- Available to all Phase 2-8 tasks

PART A: MCP Initialization Tasks (SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION REQUIRED):

IF any MCP servers are marked "needs-initialization" THEN:

  Create Phase 1 infrastructure setup tasks with dependency chain for sequential execution:

  FOR EACH MCP server requiring initialization (in discovery order):
    Create initialization task:

    Task ID: TASK-001-mcp-{server}-init
    Title: "Initialize {MCP-server-name} for project"
    Execution Phase: 1-infrastructure-setup
    Complexity: atomic
    Parallel-eligible: FALSE (MCP init must run sequentially)
    Dependencies: [previous MCP init task, if any]

    Example dependency chain:
    - TASK-001-mcp-gas-init: dependencies=none (runs first)
    - TASK-002-mcp-github-init: dependencies=[TASK-001-mcp-gas-init] (runs after gas)

    Implementation Guidance:
    "Initialize {MCP-server-name} by executing required setup commands.

    **CRITICAL State Persistence Protocol**:

    STEP 1: Capture State from Initialization
      After running the MCP initialization command, capture all returned state values.
      Example: After mcp__gas__project_create, capture scriptId value
      Example: After mcp__github__create_repository, capture repoUrl value

    STEP 2: Prepare State Entry
      Format using semantic dot-notation: '- {server}.{context}.{key}: {value}'
      Context: Use 'dev' for development, 'prod' for production
      Example: '- gas.dev.scriptId: abc123xyz'
      Example: '- github.dev.repoUrl: https://github.com/user/repo'

    STEP 3: Read Architecture File
      Read <worktree>/planning/architecture.md into memory

    STEP 4: Locate or Create Section
      Search for exact line: '## Infrastructure State'

      IF found:
        Identify last line of this section (line before next ## header or EOF)
        Your entry will be appended after last state entry in this section
      ELSE:
        Start new section at end of file:
        - Add blank line (if file not empty)
        - Add header: '## Infrastructure State'
        - Add comment line: '# Phase 1 (MCP Server Initialization)'
        - Add your state entry below the comment
      END IF

    STEP 5: Insert State Entry
      Format using semantic dot-notation: {server}.{context}.{key}: {value}
      Context for Phase 1 MCP servers: typically 'dev' or 'prod'
      Example: - gas.dev.scriptId: abc123xyz
      Add your formatted entry to the location identified in Step 4

    STEP 6: Write Updated Content
      Write complete updated content back to <worktree>/planning/architecture.md

    STEP 7: Verify (REQUIRED)
      Re-read architecture.md
      Confirm: Your entry exists in file
      Confirm: Exactly ONE '## Infrastructure State' header exists (no duplicates)
      Confirm: Entry properly formatted with '- ' prefix and semantic key pattern

      IF verification fails:
        Report failure details
        Do NOT mark task as complete
      END IF

    This persisted state will be available to all subsequent tasks via architecture.md."

    Definition of Done:
    - [ ] MCP server initialized successfully
    - [ ] State captured from initialization response
    - [ ] State persistence Steps 1-7 completed successfully
    - [ ] Verification confirms: entry exists, no duplicate headers, proper format
  END FOR

  NOTE: All feature tasks (Phase 2-8) will depend on ALL Phase 1 MCP init tasks completing.
END IF

PART B: Service Initialization Tasks (SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION REQUIRED):

IF any services are marked "needs-initialization" THEN:

  Create Phase 1 service initialization tasks with dependency chain:

  FOR EACH service requiring initialization (in dependency order):
    Create initialization task:

    Task ID: TASK-00X-service-{service-name}-init
    Title: "Initialize {service-name} for project"
    Execution Phase: 1-infrastructure-setup
    Complexity: atomic or simple (depending on service)
    Parallel-eligible: FALSE (services may have dependencies)
    Dependencies: [all MCP init tasks, previous service init task]

    Example dependency chain:
    - TASK-001-mcp-{first-server}-init (MCP init runs first)
    - TASK-002-service-{first-service}-init: dependencies=[all MCP init tasks]
    - TASK-003-service-{second-service}-init: dependencies=[TASK-002-service-{first-service}-init]

    Implementation Guidance:
    "Initialize {service-name} by executing required setup commands based on the
    service type identified in architecture.md.

    **CRITICAL State Persistence Protocol**:

    STEP 1: Capture State from Initialization
      After service initialization completes, capture ALL returned state values.
      Examples: connection strings, IDs, keys, URLs, regions, versions, credentials
      Service may return multiple state values - capture all of them

    STEP 2: Prepare State Entries
      Format each state value using semantic dot-notation: '- {service}.{context}.{key}: {value}'
      Context: Use 'dev' for development, 'prod' for production
      Multiple keys for same service: use multiple dot-notation entries
      Examples:
        '- database.dev.connectionString: postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb'
        '- database.dev.schemaVersion: 001'
        '- storage.dev.bucketName: my-app-uploads'
        '- storage.dev.region: us-east-1'

    STEP 3: Read Architecture File
      Read <worktree>/planning/architecture.md into memory

    STEP 4: Locate or Create Section
      Search for exact line: '## Infrastructure State'

      IF found:
        Identify last line of this section (line before next ## header or EOF)
        Your entries will be appended after last state entry in this section
      ELSE:
        Start new section at end of file:
        - Add blank line (if file not empty)
        - Add header: '## Infrastructure State'
        - Add comment line: '# Phase 1 (Service Initialization)'
        - Add your state entries below the comment
      END IF

    STEP 5: Insert State Entries
      Add ALL your formatted entries using semantic dot-notation
      Pattern: {service}.{context}.{key}: {value}
      Preserve logical grouping by service name
      Example ordering:
        - database.dev.connectionString: ...
        - database.dev.schemaVersion: ...
        - storage.dev.bucketName: ...

    STEP 6: Write Updated Content
      Write complete updated content back to <worktree>/planning/architecture.md

    STEP 7: Verify (REQUIRED)
      Re-read architecture.md
      Confirm: ALL your entries exist in file
      Confirm: Exactly ONE '## Infrastructure State' header exists (no duplicates)
      Confirm: All entries properly formatted with '- ' prefix and semantic key pattern

      IF verification fails:
        Report failure details
        Do NOT mark task as complete
      END IF

    STEP 8: Test Service Connectivity
      Verify service is accessible using the captured state
      Confirm service responds to basic operations

    This persisted state will be available to all subsequent tasks via architecture.md."

    Definition of Done:
    - [ ] Service initialized successfully
    - [ ] All state captured from initialization response
    - [ ] State persistence Steps 1-7 completed successfully
    - [ ] Verification confirms: all entries exist, no duplicate headers, proper format
    - [ ] Service connectivity tested and confirmed working
  END FOR

  NOTE: All feature tasks (Phase 2-8) will depend on ALL Phase 1 service init tasks.
END IF

Result: Phase 1 infrastructure setup tasks generated with sequential dependencies
```

#### 5. Feature Task Generation with Delta Detection
```markdown
Generate feature implementation tasks (Phases 2-8) using delta detection:

Process based on delta analysis results:

FOR SKIPPED ITEMS (unchanged):
  - Add to satisfaction report
  - Note existing task IDs
  - No task generation needed

FOR TECHNICAL MODIFICATIONS (requirement changed, use case unchanged):
  1. Create update task:
     - Task ID: TASK-XXX-mod
     - Title: "Update [feature] for [requirement change]"
     - Complexity: Usually simple/atomic
     - Note what technical criteria changed

FOR FEATURE MODIFICATIONS (use case changed):
  1. Create revision task(s):
     - Task ID: TASK-XXX-mod (or multiple)
     - Title: "Revise [feature] for [use case change]"
     - Complexity: Usually moderate/complex
     - Document flow changes

FOR NEW ITEMS:
  1. Assign to execution phase (1-8)
  2. Extract rich context from all input documents
  3. Apply complexity scoring based on integration density
  4. Validate completeness (dependencies handled in Step 6)

Result: Feature tasks generated for changed/new requirements with delta detection
```

#### 6. Deployment Preparation Task Generation (Phase 7 - CONDITIONAL)
```markdown
Generate Phase 7 deployment preparation tasks if needed.

**When to Generate Phase 7 Tasks**:
Read architecture.md deployment section and analyze feature requirements.

IF deployment requires infrastructure NOT handled in Phase 1:
  Generate Phase 7 deployment preparation tasks
ELSE:
  Skip Phase 7 (no additional deployment infrastructure needed)

**Decision Tree**:
- Does production deployment need different infrastructure than development?
- Are there post-validation deployment prerequisites?
- Does deployment need OAuth/security configurations finalized?
- Are there production-only services or tools to configure?

IF YES to any: Generate Phase 7 tasks
IF NO to all: Skip Phase 7

**Common Patterns Requiring Phase 7** (illustrative examples):

1. **Production Cloud Infrastructure** (separate from development)
   Examples:
   - GCP: Production project creation, production APIs enabled
   - AWS: Production account setup, production IAM roles
   - Azure: Production resource groups, production subscriptions

2. **Production OAuth/Security** (after dev testing complete)
   Examples:
   - OAuth consent screens with production scopes
   - SSL/TLS certificate activation
   - Security policy finalization
   - Production API key generation

3. **Production Service Configuration** (different from dev)
   Examples:
   - Production databases (RDS prod, Cloud SQL prod)
   - Production storage (S3 prod buckets, GCS prod)
   - Production caches (Redis prod, Memcached prod)
   - Production message queues (SQS, Pub/Sub)

4. **Deployment Tool Configuration** (production authentication)
   Examples:
   - clasp login for production deployment
   - kubectl context for production cluster
   - terraform workspace for production
   - Docker registry authentication for production

5. **Networking and DNS** (post-validation setup)
   Examples:
   - DNS configuration and cutover
   - CDN setup (CloudFront, Cloudflare)
   - Load balancer configuration
   - Firewall rules and security groups

**Task Generation** (prompt-as-code style):
FOR EACH deployment infrastructure requirement:
  Create task-XXX-deploy-prep.md with:
  - Natural language instructions: "Execute these steps...", "Navigate to...", "Run: ..."
  - State capture directives: "Capture {key} from response"
  - Persistence instructions: "Persist to architecture.md: - {component}.{context}.{key}: {value}"
  - Verification steps: "Verify by checking..."

Task metadata:
- execution-phase: 7-deployment-prep
- parallel-eligible: false (infrastructure may have dependencies)
- dependencies: [all Phase 6 validation tasks]
- complexity: atomic or simple (infrastructure setup)

State persistence:
- Append to architecture.md "## Infrastructure State"
- Use semantic keys: {component}.prod.{key} or {component}.deployment.{key}
- Examples: gcp.prod.projectId, oauth.prod.consentConfigured, ssl.prod.certificateArn

Result: Phase 7 deployment preparation tasks generated (if needed)
```

#### 7. CI/CD Execution Task Generation (Phase 8 - CONDITIONAL)
```markdown
Generate Phase 8 CI/CD deployment execution tasks if automated deployment specified.

**When to Generate Phase 8 Tasks**:
Read architecture.md deployment strategy section.

IF automated deployment specified:
  Generate Phase 8 CI/CD execution tasks
ELSE IF manual deployment:
  Generate manual deployment checklist (not tasks)
ELSE:
  Skip Phase 8 (no deployment specified)

**Decision Tree**:
- Does architecture.md specify deployment automation?
- Are there deployment scripts or tools configured?
- Is there a deployment pipeline defined?

IF YES: Generate Phase 8 automated deployment tasks
IF NO: Generate deployment checklist or skip

**Task Generation** (prompt-as-code style):
Create task-XXX-deploy-execute.md with natural language deployment steps:

Template structure:
```
## Deployment Execution

Execute these deployment steps in sequence:

1. **Pre-Deployment Verification**
   - Verify all Phase 7 infrastructure ready
   - Check architecture.md for required state values
   - Run: [pre-deployment validation command]
   - Expected: All checks pass

2. **Deployment Execution**
   - Navigate to: [deployment directory]
   - Run: [deployment command]
   - Examples:
     * clasp: "Run: clasp push && clasp deploy --description 'Production vX.Y.Z'"
     * Kubernetes: "Run: kubectl apply -f manifests/ && kubectl rollout status deployment/app"
     * Terraform: "Run: terraform apply -auto-approve"
     * Serverless: "Run: sls deploy --stage prod"

3. **Post-Deployment Verification**
   - Verify: [deployment succeeded indicator]
   - Test: [smoke test commands]
   - Capture deployment metadata (version, timestamp, deployment ID)

4. **State Persistence**
   - Persist to architecture.md "## Infrastructure State":
     * deployment.prod.version: {version}
     * deployment.prod.endpoint: {url}
     * deployment.prod.timestamp: {timestamp}
     * deployment.prod.deploymentId: {id}

5. **Rollback Procedure** (if deployment fails)
   - IF deployment fails OR smoke tests fail:
     * Run: [rollback command]
     * Examples:
       - clasp: "clasp undeploy {deploymentId} && clasp deploy --deploymentId {previous}"
       - Kubernetes: "kubectl rollout undo deployment/app"
       - Terraform: "terraform apply -auto-approve {previous-state}"
     * Verify: Rollback successful
     * Alert: Deployment failed, rolled back to previous version
```

Task metadata:
- execution-phase: 8-ci-cd
- parallel-eligible: false (deployment must be sequential)
- dependencies: [all Phase 7 tasks if present, else all Phase 6 tasks]
- complexity: simple or moderate (deployment complexity)

Common deployment patterns (examples):
- Google Apps Script: clasp push && clasp deploy
- Kubernetes: kubectl apply -f && rollout status
- AWS Lambda: sam deploy or sls deploy
- Static sites: netlify deploy or s3 sync
- Containers: docker push && kubectl set image

Result: Phase 8 CI/CD execution tasks generated (if automated deployment)
```

#### 8. Dependency Analysis & Parallel Optimization
```markdown
Analyze task dependencies and optimize for parallel execution:

1. Build Dependency Graph:
   FOR EACH generated task (infrastructure + feature tasks):
     - Extract dependencies from task metadata
     - Identify required inputs from other tasks
     - Note shared resources or state
     - Build directed dependency graph

2. Detect Dependency Cycles:
   IF cycles detected THEN:
     - Report cycle path
     - Suggest cycle-breaking strategies
     - Fail if cycles cannot be resolved

3. Assign Parallel-Eligible Flags:
   FOR EACH task:
     IF task has no dependencies OR all dependencies in earlier phases THEN:
       Check for resource conflicts with other tasks
       IF no conflicts THEN:
         Mark parallel-eligible: TRUE
       ELSE:
         Mark parallel-eligible: FALSE
     ELSE:
       Mark parallel-eligible: FALSE (has intra-phase dependencies)

4. Identify Critical Path:
   - Calculate longest dependency chain
   - Identify bottleneck tasks
   - Note tasks on critical path for priority execution

5. Generate Parallel Execution Groups:
   FOR EACH execution phase:
     Group tasks that can run concurrently
     Suggest optimal agent allocation
     Document parallelization opportunities

Result: Dependency graph built, cycles resolved, parallel execution plan created
```

#### 9. Quality Iteration Loop
```markdown
FOR iteration FROM 1 TO 10:
  Calculate quality score:
  - Delta Efficiency: (correctly skipped / total unchanged) * 20
  - Complexity: (appropriately sized tasks / total new) * 20
  - Context: (tasks with full context / total generated) * 25
  - Coverage: (changed items with tasks / total changed) * 20
  - Phase Organization: (correctly phased / total) * 15

  IF quality score >= 90:
    Break from loop (phase complete)
  OTHERWISE:
    Document gaps and return to execution with refinements
```

## Phase 2: Validation & Output Generation

**Purpose**: Validate LLM-readiness and generate feature-developer.md compatible output with full context

### Activities

#### 1. Traceability Matrix Generation
```markdown
Build comprehensive traceability including existing coverage:

For each requirement:
  IF already satisfied:
    Reference existing task, Note as "Unchanged"
  ELSE IF modified:
    Reference modification task, Note as "Updated"
  ELSE:
    Reference new task, Note as "New"

Create delta-aware traceability matrix:
| Requirement | Tasks | Coverage | Status | Change Type |
|-------------|-------|----------|--------|-------------|
| REQ-001     | TASK-001 | 100%   | ‚úì   | Unchanged   |
| REQ-002     | TASK-002-mod | 100% | ‚úì  | Modified    |
| REQ-050     | TASK-050 | 100%   | ‚úì   | New         |
```

#### 2. Interface Validation
```markdown
Validate shared context and interface compatibility:
- Extract common patterns across tasks
- Document shared resources and interfaces
- Validate interface contract compatibility
- Validate shared constraints don't conflict
- Note integration points between tasks
```

#### 3. Critical Path Analysis
```markdown
Generate critical path:
- Identify longest dependency chain
- Mark parallel execution groups
- Note resource bottlenecks
- Validate no cycles remain after Phase 1 fixes
```

#### 4. Task File Generation
```markdown
For each task, create: task-NNN.md (or task-NNN-mod.md for modifications)

Task File Format:
---
task-id: TASK-NNN
title: [Clear outcome-focused title]
task-type: [new|modification|technical-update]
execution-phase: [1-infrastructure-setup|2-migration|3-feature-core|4-feature-ui|5-integration|6-validation|7-deployment-prep|8-ci-cd]
complexity: [atomic|simple|moderate|complex]
parallel-eligible: [true|false]
source-requirements: [REQ-XXX, REQ-YYY]
source-use-cases: [UC-XXX, UC-YYY]
modifies: [TASK-XXX]  # Only for modifications
change-reason: [Use case change|Requirement change|Both]  # Only for modifications
dependencies: [TASK-XXX, TASK-YYY]
---

## Outcome Definition
[Clear, measurable outcome - what exists after completion]

## Change Context
[Only for modifications: What changed and why]
- Original: [What was implemented before]
- Change: [What needs to be different]
- Reason: [Use case evolution, requirement update, etc.]

## Definition of Ready
[From use case - conditions that must be met before starting]
- Technical prerequisites
- Knowledge requirements
- Resource availability
- Dependency completion

## Implementation Guidance
[From requirement - non-prescriptive approach]
### Approach
[High-level strategy without implementation details]

### Primary Flow
[Main steps to achieve outcome]

### Error Handling
[Failure modes to consider]

## Architectural Context
[From architecture.md - technology decisions and patterns]
### Technology Stack
[Relevant technology choices with rationale]

### Patterns to Apply
[Architectural patterns from architecture.md]

### MCP Tools Available
[From architecture.md - if MCP servers were discovered]
[List primary/secondary MCP server tools that can be used for this task]
[Example: mcp__gas__write for Code.gs files, mcp__gas__run for testing]

### Infrastructure State References

When generating this task file, examine <worktree>/planning/architecture.md for infrastructure state:

1. Look for section titled "## Infrastructure State"

IF section exists in architecture.md THEN:
  Create subsection in this task documenting available state:

  **Available Infrastructure State**:

  For each state entry found, list using semantic dot-notation format:
  - {component}.{context}.{key}: {value-from-architecture.md}

  Add usage guidance:
  "This state was created by Phase 1 infrastructure setup tasks and may include deployment state from Phase 7/8.
  Reference these values in your implementation using the component.context.key pattern.
  For example, use gas.dev.scriptId when calling mcp__gas__write, or database.dev.connectionString for DB setup."

  Example output format:
  **Infrastructure State** (from architecture.md):
  - gas.dev.scriptId: abc123xyz
  - github.dev.repoUrl: https://github.com/user/repo
  - database.dev.connectionString: postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb
  - storage.dev.bucketName: my-app-uploads
  - storage.dev.region: us-east-1
  - auth.dev.clientId: xyz789
  - gas.prod.scriptId: xyz789_prod (if deployment state exists)
  - deployment.prod.endpoint: https://api.example.com (if deployed)

ELSE:
  Add note: "No infrastructure state available (Phase 1 infrastructure setup not needed for this project)"
END IF

**Note**: feature-developer.md will automatically provide architecture.md in the
implementation context, making all state readily accessible.

### Infrastructure State Management

**ALL infrastructure state persists to architecture.md** in a single unified section:

```markdown
## Infrastructure State

Use semantic dot-notation keys to organize state by component and context.

Pattern: {component}.{context}.{key}: {value}

Common contexts: dev, prod, staging, test, deployment

State sources and examples:

**Phase 1 (Infrastructure Setup)**:
- gas.dev.scriptId: abc123_dev
- database.dev.connectionString: postgresql://localhost:5432/app
- redis.dev.host: localhost, redis.dev.port: 6379
- auth.dev.clientId: dev_xyz123

**Phase 7 (Deployment Preparation)**:
- gas.prod.scriptId: xyz789_prod
- database.prod.connectionString: postgresql://prod-db:5432/app
- gcp.prod.projectId: myapp-prod-123456
- oauth.prod.consentConfigured: true
- ssl.prod.certificateArn: arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:123:certificate/abc

**Phase 8 (CI/CD Execution)**:
- deployment.prod.version: v1.0.0
- deployment.prod.endpoint: https://api.example.com/v1
- deployment.prod.timestamp: 2025-10-04T12:00:00Z
- deployment.prod.deploymentId: d-abc123xyz

**Phase 10 (Feature-Generated State)**:
- api.deployment.endpoint: https://api.example.com/v1
- auth.prod.callbackUrl: https://app.example.com/callback
- storage.prod.bucketName: app-uploads-prod

Benefits of unified state:
- Single source of truth in architecture.md
- Flexible namespacing via dot notation
- Clear context separation (dev vs prod)
- No taxonomy enforcement (adapt to project needs)
- Scales to any infrastructure pattern
```

**State Persistence Protocol** (referenced in Phase 1, 7, 8 tasks):
1. Capture state from initialization/deployment
2. Format as: {component}.{context}.{key}: {value}
3. Read architecture.md
4. Locate or create "## Infrastructure State" section
5. Append new state entries
6. Write updated architecture.md
7. Verify entries persisted correctly

```

## GLOBAL END

**Execute ONCE after Phase 2 completion to finalize and validate**

### Global Quality Validation

```markdown
1. DELTA VALIDATION:
   For unchanged items: Verify correctly skipped
   For modified items: Verify modification task created
   For new items: Verify new task created

2. EVIDENCE GATHERING:
   For each requirement: Find implementing tasks, verify complexity scoring
   For each use case: Find implementing tasks, verify end-to-end coverage

3. GLOBAL QUALITY SCORE CALCULATION:
   GLOBAL_QUALITY_SCORE = (
     (DELTA_EFFICIENCY * 0.15) +            // Correctly skipped unchanged items
     (COMPLEXITY_APPROPRIATENESS * 0.15) +  // Tasks properly sized for LLMs
     (CONTEXT_COMPLETENESS * 0.20) +        // Rich context preserved
     (PHASE_ORGANIZATION * 0.15) +          // Correct execution sequencing
     (REQUIREMENT_COVERAGE * 0.15) +        // All changed requirements have tasks
     (USE_CASE_COVERAGE * 0.15) +          // All changed use cases traced
     (LLM_READINESS * 0.05)                // Guidance over prescription
   )

   MINIMUM_ACCEPTABLE_SCORE = 9.0/10.0

4. WORKTREE CONSOLIDATION (if created):
   IF <worktree_created> == true THEN:
     echo "üì¶ Consolidating results back to main environment"

     # Copy generated tasks to original location
     cp -r "<worktree>/planning/pending" "<original_pwd>/planning/pending"

     # Commit results in worktree
     git -C "<worktree>" add -A
     git -C "<worktree>" commit -m "Generated tasks from requirements"

     # Create patch for review
     git -C "<worktree>" format-patch -1 --stdout > "<original_pwd>/task-generation.patch"

     echo "‚úÖ Tasks generated and patch created for review"
   END IF

GLOBAL_END complete - task generation finalized
```

### Quality Assessment Thresholds

- **9.5-10.0**: Excellent - Ready for LLM execution
- **9.0-9.4**: Good - Minor context additions may help
- **8.0-8.9**: Acceptable - Some guidance gaps remain
- **Below 8.0**: Requires remediation

## Task Execution Sequencing

### Execution Phase Organization

```markdown
Generate execution phase flowchart showing LLM execution phases:

- **Phase 1 (Infrastructure Setup)**: Development and/or deployment infrastructure (CONDITIONAL - if needed)
- **Phase 2 (Migration)**: Data/schema changes, sequential within phase
- **Phase 3-4 (Features/UI)**: Parallel execution possible by multiple agents
- **Phase 5 (Integration)**: Requires feature completion, sequential
- **Phase 6 (Validation)**: Testing tasks, can parallelize by test type
- **Phase 7 (Deployment Prep)**: Deployment infrastructure preparation (CONDITIONAL - if needed)
- **Phase 8 (CI/CD)**: Automated deployment execution (CONDITIONAL - if automated)

Parallel execution opportunities: [Phase 3-4 tasks, Phase 6 tasks by type]
Critical path: [Phase 1 (if needed) ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 5 ‚Üí 6 ‚Üí 7 (if needed) ‚Üí 8 (if needed)]
Conditional phases: [Phase 1, 7, 8 - only generate if architecture.md indicates need]
Bottleneck phases: [Integration typically bottleneck]
LLM agent allocation: [Suggest agent-per-feature strategy for Phase 3-4]
```

## Return Summary

After completing both phases and global end, return concise summary:

```markdown
# Feature Task Generation Complete

## Summary
- **Tasks Generated**: [count] (new: [X], modifications: [Y])
- **Tasks Skipped**: [count] (unchanged items already satisfied)
- **Global Quality Score**: [X/10.0]
- **Delta Efficiency**: [X%] (correctly identified unchanged items)

## Coverage Analysis
- Total Use Cases: [X] ([Y] unchanged, [Z] changed/new)
- Total Requirements: [A] ([B] unchanged, [C] changed/new)
- Coverage: [100%] of changed items have implementing tasks

## Generated Task Files
- New Tasks: [task-050.md, task-051.md, ...]
- Modification Tasks: [task-001-mod.md, task-002-mod.md, ...]
- Files Location: `<worktree>/planning/pending/`

## Execution Phases
- Phase 1 (Infrastructure Setup): [X] tasks (conditional)
- Phase 2 (Migration): [Y] tasks
- Phase 3-4 (Features): [Z] tasks (parallel eligible)
- Phase 5 (Integration): [A] tasks
- Phase 6 (Validation): [B] tasks
- Phase 7 (Deployment Prep): [C] tasks (conditional)
- Phase 8 (CI/CD): [D] tasks (conditional)

## Next Steps
1. Review generated tasks in `<worktree>/planning/pending/`
2. Execute tasks via feature-developer agent in phase order
3. Use parallel execution for Phase 3-4 tasks when possible
4. Follow critical path: Infrastructure Setup ‚Üí Migration ‚Üí Features ‚Üí Integration ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Deployment Prep ‚Üí CI/CD
5. Note: Conditional phases (1, 7, 8) only present if architecture.md indicates need

## Efficiency Metrics
- Reuse Rate: [X%] of requirements already satisfied
- Delta Accuracy: [Y%] correctly identified as unchanged
- Generation Efficiency: Only [Z%] of total items needed new tasks

The complete task decomposition with delta detection has generated only the necessary tasks while preserving full context for LLM execution.
```

Execute systematically, detect changes accurately, decompose intelligently, preserve context completely.
