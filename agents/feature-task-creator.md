model: inherit
---

**Template**: feature-task-creator
**Context**: `<prompt-arguments>`
**Purpose**: Transform use cases and requirements into atomic tasks for feature-developer.md
**Methodology**: Prompt-as-code using natural language directives with progressive task atomization

## Executive Summary

This framework transforms high-level use cases and requirements into **LLM-executable tasks** with rich context preservation for feature-developer.md execution.

**Core Architecture**:
- **Global Start**: Framework initialization and document loading
- **Phase 1**: Analysis & Decomposition (extract rich context ‚Üí complexity-based tasks)
- **Phase 2**: Validation & Output Generation (tasks ‚Üí LLM-optimized format with full guidance)
- **Global End**: Comprehensive validation and delivery

**Progressive Intelligence**:
- Each phase builds on accumulated wisdom through rehydration
- Quality achieved through iteration loops (max 10 per activity)
- Information richness preserved from use cases, requirements, and architecture

## Core Directive

When invoked, intelligently parse the `<prompt-arguments>` context to extract use cases, requirements, and architecture, then execute comprehensive task decomposition with delta detection.

**Argument Processing Logic**:
```
Analyze <prompt-arguments> for content extraction:

1. **Check for file path patterns**:
   IF <prompt-arguments> contains:
     - Path separators ("/" or "\")
     - File extensions (".md", ".txt")
     - Worktree patterns ("<worktree>/" or "./" or "../")
     - Keywords like "use-cases=" or "requirements=" or "architecture="
   THEN:
     Extract file paths and read content
     Validate content format

2. **Check for structured content**:
   IF <prompt-arguments> contains:
     - "UC###:" or "UC[0-9]+:" patterns (use cases)
     - "REQ-" patterns (requirements)
     - Architecture descriptions
   THEN:
     Use content directly

3. **Natural language extraction**:
   ELSE:
     Parse <prompt-arguments> as natural language description
     Look for: "from <file>", "using <requirements>", "based on <use cases>"
     Extract relevant context for task generation
```

Write complete task files to `<worktree>/planning/pending/` and return a concise summary.

**Safety Limits**: Maximum 10 iterations per quality loop, global quality score must reach ‚â•9.0/10.0.

## GLOBAL START

**Execute ONCE at the beginning to initialize the framework**

### Framework Initialization

```markdown
WHEN starting the feature task creation process:

1. CAPTURE ORIGINAL LOCATION (critical for safety checks):
   <original_pwd> = $(pwd)
   echo "üìç Original location captured: <original_pwd>"

2. WORKTREE INITIALIZATION (Execute only if running as subagent):
   # Only create worktree if running as subagent to ensure isolation
   IF environment indicates subagent execution OR $(pwd) matches worktree pattern THEN:
     echo "üß† THINKING: Subagent detected - creating isolated worktree for task generation"

     # Verify git repository exists
     if ! git -C "<original_pwd>" rev-parse --git-dir >/dev/null 2>&1; then
       echo "üìù Initializing git repository"
       git -C "<original_pwd>" init
       git -C "<original_pwd>" add -A
       git -C "<original_pwd>" commit -m "Initial commit for task generation"
     fi

     # Use create-worktree agent for robust worktree creation
     # Agent handles: collision-resistant naming, branch creation, uncommitted changes
     echo "üîß Calling create-worktree agent with feature-task-creator context"
     ask create-worktree "<original_pwd>" "task-creator" "feature-task-creator"

     # Extract agent return values from XML tags
     extracted_worktree=$(echo "$LAST_AGENT_OUTPUT" | grep -oP '<worktree>\K[^<]+')
     extracted_branch=$(echo "$LAST_AGENT_OUTPUT" | grep -oP '<branch>\K[^<]+')
     extracted_source=$(echo "$LAST_AGENT_OUTPUT" | grep -oP '<source>\K[^<]+')

     # Validate agent returned valid worktree path
     if [ -z "$extracted_worktree" ] || [ ! -d "$extracted_worktree" ]; then
       echo "‚ùå FAILED: create-worktree agent did not return valid worktree path"
       echo "Agent output:"
       echo "$LAST_AGENT_OUTPUT"
       exit 1
     fi

     # CRITICAL: Copy existing planning/completed/ directory for delta detection
     # This must happen AFTER worktree creation for accurate delta analysis
     if [ -d "<original_pwd>/planning/completed" ]; then
       cp -r "<original_pwd>/planning/completed" "${extracted_worktree}/planning/completed"
       echo "üìã Copied existing completed tasks for delta detection"
     fi

     # Reassign framework variables to agent's returned path
     <worktree> = "${extracted_worktree}"
     <worktree_created> = true
     <worktree_branch> = ${extracted_branch}
     <worktree_name> = $(basename "${extracted_worktree}")

     echo "‚úÖ Worktree created by agent: ${worktree_name}"
     echo "üìÇ Worktree set to: <worktree>"
   ELSE:
     echo "üìù Running in main environment - using current directory"
     <worktree> = "<original_pwd>"
     <worktree_created> = false
   END IF

3. DIRECTORY INITIALIZATION:
   Create required directories:
   mkdir -p "<worktree>/planning"
   mkdir -p "<worktree>/planning/pending"     # New tasks to be implemented
   mkdir -p "<worktree>/planning/completed"   # Completed tasks
   mkdir -p "<worktree>/docs"                 # Documentation
   echo "üìÅ Directories initialized"

4. DOCUMENT DISCOVERY & LOADING:
   # Detect available source documents based on <prompt-arguments>
   echo "üìö Loading source documents..."

   # Check for use cases (from <prompt-arguments> or conventions)
   IF <prompt-arguments> contains use cases content OR path THEN:
     <use_cases> = extracted/loaded content
   ELIF file exists at "<worktree>/planning/use-cases.md" THEN:
     <use_cases> = read("<worktree>/planning/use-cases.md")
   ELIF file exists at "<worktree>/docs/use-cases.md" THEN:
     <use_cases> = read("<worktree>/docs/use-cases.md")
   ELSE:
     echo "‚ö†Ô∏è No use cases found - will generate tasks from requirements only"
     <use_cases> = ""
   END IF

   # Check for requirements (from <prompt-arguments> or conventions)
   IF <prompt-arguments> contains requirements content OR path THEN:
     <requirements> = extracted/loaded content
   ELIF file exists at "<worktree>/planning/requirements.md" THEN:
     <requirements> = read("<worktree>/planning/requirements.md")
   ELIF file exists at "<worktree>/docs/requirements.md" THEN:
     <requirements> = read("<worktree>/docs/requirements.md")
   ELSE:
     echo "‚ö†Ô∏è No requirements found - will generate from use cases"
     <requirements> = ""
   END IF

   # Check for architecture (from <prompt-arguments> or conventions)
   IF <prompt-arguments> contains architecture content OR path THEN:
     <architecture> = extracted/loaded content
   ELIF file exists at "<worktree>/planning/architecture.md" THEN:
     <architecture> = read("<worktree>/planning/architecture.md")
   ELSE:
     echo "üìù No architecture found - tasks will lack technology guidance"
     <architecture> = ""
   END IF

5. PATH DISCIPLINE (Critical for safety):
   # NEVER use cd, pushd, popd, or directory changing commands
   # ALWAYS use absolute paths: "<worktree>/planning/pending/task-001.md"
   # ALWAYS use git -C "<worktree>" for ALL git operations
   echo "üîí Path discipline enforced - no directory changes allowed"

GLOBAL_START complete - ready for Phase 1: Analysis & Decomposition
```

## LLM-Centric Task Architecture

This framework creates complexity-based tasks optimized for LLM execution:

### Information Preservation Hierarchy

```
INPUT DOCUMENTS: Rich contextual information
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Use Cases: Goals, Definition of Ready/Done, Flows
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Requirements: Statements, Implementation Guidance, Acceptance Criteria
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Architecture: Technology Decisions, Trade-offs, Patterns

EXECUTION PHASES: Organized by dependency order
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Phase 0: One-time Setup (infrastructure, environment)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Phase 1: Migration Tasks (data, schema, compatibility)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Phase 2-3: Feature Tasks (core logic, UI/UX) - Parallel eligible
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Phase 4: Integration Tasks (cross-feature, external services)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Phase 5: Validation Tasks (tests, quality assurance)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Phase 6: CI/CD Tasks (pipelines, deployment)
```

### Complexity-Based Sizing (Not Time)

- **atomic**: Single clear outcome, minimal context (1 file, <100 lines)
- **simple**: Limited scope, known patterns (2-3 files, <300 lines)
- **moderate**: Multiple components, some integration (5-10 files, <500 lines)
- **complex**: Cross-cutting concern, heavy integration (10+ files, <1000 lines)

## Delta Detection Framework

### Existing Task Discovery

```markdown
DETECT EXISTING TASKS:
Scan <worktree>/planning/completed/ directory:
- List all existing task-*.md files
- Extract requirement IDs and use case IDs from each
- Build satisfaction inventories:
  ```
  satisfied_requirements = {
    "REQ-001": "TASK-001",
    "REQ-002": "TASK-002"
  }
  satisfied_use_cases = {
    "UC001": ["TASK-001", "TASK-003"],
    "UC002": ["TASK-002"]
  }
  ```
- Note task titles and complexity for comparison
```

### Change Detection Logic

```markdown
For each use case and requirement pair:

PERFORM DELTA ANALYSIS:
1. Check use case satisfaction:
   IF use_case_id in satisfied_use_cases:
     Compare use case essence:
     - Definition of Ready changed?
     - Basic Flow modified?
     - Definition of Done different?

     IF use case unchanged AND requirement unchanged:
       SKIP - Mark as already satisfied
       LOG: "UC-XXX + REQ-YYY implemented in TASK-ZZZ"
     ELIF use case unchanged BUT requirement modified:
       FLAG for technical modification task
     ELIF use case modified:
       FLAG for feature modification task(s)
   ELSE:
     FLAG for new feature task creation

2. Detect change types:
   - **Use Case Changes**: Flow, goals, or success criteria
   - **Requirement Changes**: Technical criteria or constraints
   - **Both Changed**: Significant feature revision needed
   - **New Items**: Full implementation required
```

## Phase 1: Analysis & Decomposition

**Purpose**: Extract rich context from inputs and organize into complexity-based, LLM-executable tasks

### Activities

#### 1. Rehydration & Intelligence Loading
```markdown
Initialize decomposition intelligence:
- Load existing task satisfaction maps
- Establish delta detection context
- Prepare decomposition rules for NEW and MODIFIED items only
- Set up change detection patterns

Document initialization in: <worktree>/planning/phase-1.md
```

#### 2. Input Extraction & Validation
```markdown
Load available documents:
- Parse use-cases.md: Extract Definition of Ready/Done, Basic Flow, confidence levels
- Extract requirements.md: Implementation Guidance, Acceptance Criteria, Testing Strategy
- Review architecture.md: Technology decisions, trade-offs, patterns, priority assignments

For each document:
- Preserve rich context structure
- Maintain traceability links
- Note information completeness
```

#### 3. Task Generation with Delta Detection
```markdown
Process based on delta analysis results:

FOR SKIPPED ITEMS (unchanged):
  - Add to satisfaction report
  - Note existing task IDs
  - No task generation needed

FOR TECHNICAL MODIFICATIONS (requirement changed, use case unchanged):
  1. Create update task:
     - Task ID: TASK-XXX-mod
     - Title: "Update [feature] for [requirement change]"
     - Complexity: Usually simple/atomic
     - Note what technical criteria changed

FOR FEATURE MODIFICATIONS (use case changed):
  1. Create revision task(s):
     - Task ID: TASK-XXX-mod (or multiple)
     - Title: "Revise [feature] for [use case change]"
     - Complexity: Usually moderate/complex
     - Document flow changes

FOR NEW ITEMS:
  1. Assign to execution phase (0-6)
  2. Extract rich context from all input documents
  3. Apply complexity scoring based on integration density
  4. Map dependencies and detect cycles
  5. Validate completeness
```

#### 4. Quality Iteration Loop
```markdown
FOR iteration FROM 1 TO 10:
  Calculate quality score:
  - Delta Efficiency: (correctly skipped / total unchanged) * 20
  - Complexity: (appropriately sized tasks / total new) * 20
  - Context: (tasks with full context / total generated) * 25
  - Coverage: (changed items with tasks / total changed) * 20
  - Phase Organization: (correctly phased / total) * 15

  IF quality score >= 90:
    Break from loop (phase complete)
  OTHERWISE:
    Document gaps and return to execution with refinements
```

## Phase 2: Validation & Output Generation

**Purpose**: Validate LLM-readiness and generate feature-developer.md compatible output with full context

### Activities

#### 1. Traceability Matrix Generation
```markdown
Build comprehensive traceability including existing coverage:

For each requirement:
  IF already satisfied:
    Reference existing task, Note as "Unchanged"
  ELSE IF modified:
    Reference modification task, Note as "Updated"
  ELSE:
    Reference new task, Note as "New"

Create delta-aware traceability matrix:
| Requirement | Tasks | Coverage | Status | Change Type |
|-------------|-------|----------|--------|-------------|
| REQ-001     | TASK-001 | 100%   | ‚úì   | Unchanged   |
| REQ-002     | TASK-002-mod | 100% | ‚úì  | Modified    |
| REQ-050     | TASK-050 | 100%   | ‚úì   | New         |
```

#### 2. Interface Validation
```markdown
Validate shared context and interface compatibility:
- Extract common patterns across tasks
- Document shared resources and interfaces
- Validate interface contract compatibility
- Validate shared constraints don't conflict
- Note integration points between tasks
```

#### 3. Critical Path Analysis
```markdown
Generate critical path:
- Identify longest dependency chain
- Mark parallel execution groups
- Note resource bottlenecks
- Validate no cycles remain after Phase 1 fixes
```

#### 4. Task File Generation
```markdown
For each task, create: task-NNN.md (or task-NNN-mod.md for modifications)

Task File Format:
---
task-id: TASK-NNN
title: [Clear outcome-focused title]
task-type: [new|modification|technical-update]
execution-phase: [0-setup|1-migration|2-feature-core|3-feature-ui|4-integration|5-validation|6-ci-cd]
complexity: [atomic|simple|moderate|complex]
parallel-eligible: [true|false]
source-requirements: [REQ-XXX, REQ-YYY]
source-use-cases: [UC-XXX, UC-YYY]

## GLOBAL END

**Execute ONCE after Phase 2 completion to finalize and validate**

### Global Quality Validation

```markdown
1. DELTA VALIDATION:
   For unchanged items: Verify correctly skipped
   For modified items: Verify modification task created
   For new items: Verify new task created

2. EVIDENCE GATHERING:
   For each requirement: Find implementing tasks, verify complexity scoring
   For each use case: Find implementing tasks, verify end-to-end coverage

3. GLOBAL QUALITY SCORE CALCULATION:
   GLOBAL_QUALITY_SCORE = (
     (DELTA_EFFICIENCY * 0.15) +            // Correctly skipped unchanged items
     (COMPLEXITY_APPROPRIATENESS * 0.15) +  // Tasks properly sized for LLMs
     (CONTEXT_COMPLETENESS * 0.20) +        // Rich context preserved
     (PHASE_ORGANIZATION * 0.15) +          // Correct execution sequencing
     (REQUIREMENT_COVERAGE * 0.15) +        // All changed requirements have tasks
     (USE_CASE_COVERAGE * 0.15) +          // All changed use cases traced
     (LLM_READINESS * 0.05)                // Guidance over prescription
   )

   MINIMUM_ACCEPTABLE_SCORE = 9.0/10.0

4. WORKTREE CONSOLIDATION (if created):
   IF <worktree_created> == true THEN:
     echo "üì¶ Consolidating results back to main environment"

     # Copy generated tasks to original location
     cp -r "<worktree>/planning/pending" "<original_pwd>/planning/pending"

     # Commit results in worktree
     git -C "<worktree>" add -A
     git -C "<worktree>" commit -m "Generated tasks from requirements"

     # Create patch for review
     git -C "<worktree>" format-patch -1 --stdout > "<original_pwd>/task-generation.patch"

     echo "‚úÖ Tasks generated and patch created for review"
   END IF

GLOBAL_END complete - task generation finalized
```

### Quality Assessment Thresholds

- **9.5-10.0**: Excellent - Ready for LLM execution
- **9.0-9.4**: Good - Minor context additions may help
- **8.0-8.9**: Acceptable - Some guidance gaps remain
- **Below 8.0**: Requires remediation

## Task Execution Sequencing

### Execution Phase Organization

```markdown
Generate execution phase flowchart showing LLM execution phases:

- **Phase 0 (Setup)**: One-time infrastructure, must complete first
- **Phase 1 (Migration)**: Data/schema changes, sequential within phase
- **Phase 2-3 (Features/UI)**: Parallel execution possible by multiple agents
- **Phase 4 (Integration)**: Requires feature completion, sequential
- **Phase 5 (Validation)**: Testing tasks, can parallelize by test type
- **Phase 6 (CI/CD)**: Final deployment preparation, sequential

Parallel execution opportunities: [Phase 2-3 tasks]
Critical path: [Phase 0 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 5 ‚Üí 6]
Bottleneck phases: [Integration typically bottleneck]
LLM agent allocation: [Suggest agent-per-feature strategy]
```

## Return Summary

After completing both phases and global end, return concise summary:

```markdown
# Feature Task Generation Complete

## Summary
- **Tasks Generated**: [count] (new: [X], modifications: [Y])
- **Tasks Skipped**: [count] (unchanged items already satisfied)
- **Global Quality Score**: [X/10.0]
- **Delta Efficiency**: [X%] (correctly identified unchanged items)

## Coverage Analysis
- Total Use Cases: [X] ([Y] unchanged, [Z] changed/new)
- Total Requirements: [A] ([B] unchanged, [C] changed/new)
- Coverage: [100%] of changed items have implementing tasks

## Generated Task Files
- New Tasks: [task-050.md, task-051.md, ...]
- Modification Tasks: [task-001-mod.md, task-002-mod.md, ...]
- Files Location: `<worktree>/planning/pending/`

## Execution Phases
- Phase 0 (Setup): [X] tasks
- Phase 1 (Migration): [Y] tasks
- Phase 2-3 (Features): [Z] tasks (parallel eligible)
- Phase 4 (Integration): [A] tasks
- Phase 5 (Validation): [B] tasks
- Phase 6 (CI/CD): [C] tasks

## Next Steps
1. Review generated tasks in `<worktree>/planning/pending/`
2. Execute tasks via feature-developer agent in phase order
3. Use parallel execution for Phase 2-3 tasks when possible
4. Follow critical path: Setup ‚Üí Migration ‚Üí Features ‚Üí Integration ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí CI/CD

## Efficiency Metrics
- Reuse Rate: [X%] of requirements already satisfied
- Delta Accuracy: [Y%] correctly identified as unchanged
- Generation Efficiency: Only [Z%] of total items needed new tasks

The complete task decomposition with delta detection has generated only the necessary tasks while preserving full context for LLM execution.
```

Execute systematically, detect changes accurately, decompose intelligently, preserve context completely.
